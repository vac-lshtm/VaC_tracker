293,27500,The Effect of Pandemic Prevalence on the Reported Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidates: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"ImportanceThe efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates reported in Phase 3 trials varies from [~]45% to [~]95%. It is important to explain the reasons for this heterogeneity.

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates falls with increasing prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data SourcesClinicalTrials.gov, WHO, McGill and LSHTM trackers of COVID-19 candidate vaccines, peer reviewed publications, and press releases were searched until March 31st, 2021.

Study SelectionAll RCTs reporting efficacy outcomes from Phase 3 trials till March 31st, 2021 were included. Of the 11 vaccine candidates that had started their Phase 3 trials by November 1, 2020. Phase 3 efficacy outcomes were available for 8 vaccine candidates. (PROSPERO CRD42021243121).

Data Extraction and SynthesisBoth authors independently extracted the data required from identified sources, using PRISMA guidelines. The analysis included all RCTs reported in peer reviewed publications and publicly available sources. A random effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimator was used to summarize the treatment effects. Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 infections per protocol in vaccine and placebo groups, risk ratio, prevalence of the COVID-19 infection rate in the populations where the Phase 3 trials were conducted.

Results8 vaccine candidates had reported efficacy data from a total of 20 independent Phase 3 trials, representing a total of 221,968 subjects, 453 infections across the vaccinated groups and 1,554 infections across the placebo groups. The overall estimate of the risk-ratio is 0.24 (95% CI, 0.17-0.34, p < 0.01), with an I2 statistic of 88.73%. The meta-regression analysis with pandemic prevalence as the moderator explains almost half the variance in risk ratios across trials (R2=49.06%, p<0.01).

Conclusion and RelevancePandemic prevalence explains almost half of the between-trial variance in reported efficacies. Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates declines as the pandemic prevalence increases.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic explain the heterogeneity in efficacies reported across Phase 3 trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates?

FindingsAlmost 50% of the variance in efficacies reported across Phase 3 trials can be explained by differences in COVID-19 infection rate prevailing across trials. Efficacy of evaluated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates falls significantly with increasing prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic across trial sites.

MeaningEfficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates needs to be interpreted in conjunction with the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjustment for location-level prevalence analysis would provide better insights into the efficacy results of Phase 3 trials.",07/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.05.21258394,Rajeev Sharma,University of Waikato,medrxiv,Systematic review - efficacy,0,,

65,13167,"Immunogenicity and Safety of a SARS-CoV-2 Inactivated Vaccine in Healthy Adults Aged 18-59 years: Report of the Randomized, Double-blind, and Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Clinical Trial","BACKGROUNDThe top priority for the control of COVID-19 pandemic currently is the development of a vaccine. A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac).

METHODSWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 g/0.5 mL or 6 g /0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were taken for antibody assay.

RESULTSCoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed. Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good immunogenicity with the lower 3 g dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day 0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among different dosage and vaccination schedules.

CONCLUSIONSFavorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated on both schedules and both dosages, which support the conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule/dosage per different scenarios.",10/08/2020,10.1101/2020.07.31.20161216,Feng-Cai Zhu,Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention,medrxiv,pubmed,0,,
68,13052,First-in-Human Trial of a SARS CoV 2 Recombinant Spike Protein Nanoparticle Vaccine,"BackgroundNVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. We present the Day 35 primary analysis of our trial of NVX-CoV2373 with or without the saponin-based Matrix-M1 adjuvant in healthy adults.

MethodsThis is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial in 131 healthy adults. Trial vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart. Primary outcomes were reactogenicity, safety labs, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, wild-type virus neutralizing antibody, and T-cell responses.

ResultsParticipants received NVX-CoV2373 with or without Matrix-M1 (n=106) or placebo (n=25). There were no serious adverse events. Reactogenicity was mainly mild in severity and of short duration (mean [&le;]2 days), with second vaccinations inducing greater local and systemic reactogenicity. The adjuvant significantly enhanced immune responses and was antigen dose-sparing, and the two-dose 5g NVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 vaccine induced mean anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody responses that exceeded the mean responses in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients with clinically significant illnesses. The vaccine also induced antigen-specific T cells with a largely T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 was well tolerated and elicited robust immune responses (IgG and neutralization) four-fold higher than the mean observed in COVID-19 convalescent serum from participants with clinical symptoms requiring medical care and induced CD4+ T-cell responses biased toward a Th1 phenotype. These findings suggest that the vaccine may confer protection and support transition to efficacy evaluations to test this hypothesis.

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available.

MethodsHealthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level.

We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

ResultsIn both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose- dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera.

87,15723,"Safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine candidate: interim results of a phase 1/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

90,16299,An in-depth investigation of the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,"BACKGROUNDIn-depth investigations of the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed.

METHODIn a phase I randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial involving 192 healthy adults 18-59 years of age, two injections of three different doses (50 EU, 100 EU and 150 EU) of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or the placebo were administered intramuscularly with a 2- or 4-week interval between the injections. The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated within 28 days.

FINDINGIn this study, 191 subjects assigned to three doses groups or the placebo group completed the 28-day trial. There were 44 adverse reactions within the 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue, and no abnormal variations were observed in 48 cytokines in the serum samples of immunized subjects. The serum samples diluted from 1:32 to 1:4096 and incubated with the virus did not show antibody-dependent enhancement effects (ADEs) with regard to human natural killer cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. At day 14, the seroconversion rates had reached 92%, 100% and 96% with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.0, 54.5 and 37.1, and at day 28, the seroconversion rates had reached 80%, 96% and 92% with GMTs of 10.6, 15.4 and 19.6in 0, 14 and 0, 28 procedures, respectively. Seroconversion was associated with the synchronous upregulation of ELISA antibodies against the S protein, N protein and virion and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Transcriptome analysis shaped the genetic diversity of immune response induced by the vaccine.

INTERPRETATIONIn a population aged 18-59 years, this inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was safe and immunogenic.

105,17897,Phase 1 trial of a Candidate Recombinant Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 Disease Produced in Plants,"Longer AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004)

MethodsThe study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 {micro}g, 7.5 {micro}g, and 15 {micro}g) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42.

ResultsA total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN{gamma} and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups.

ConclusionThese data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 g CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were [~]10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 g)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations

Shorter AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSVirus-like particles (VLP) displaying recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers were produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. This candidate vaccine (CoVLP) was evaluated in healthy adults 18-55 years of age alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 (NCT04450004).

MethodsThis randomized, partially-blinded, two-dose, dose-escalation study assessed CoVLP (3.75, 7.5 or 15 {micro}g/dose) administered intramuscularly alone or with CpG1018 or AS03 in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults (18-55 years). Primary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity are reported to day 42. Neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) were assessed using a VSV pseudovirus assay and cellular responses by ELISpot (IFN{gamma}, IL-4).

Results180 subjects (avg.34.3yrs) were recruited. All formulations were well-tolerated but adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Adverse events were highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups and increased in frequency/severity after dose two. CoVLP alone elicited weak humoral responses but modest cellular responses were detectable after dose two. Both adjuvants increased immunogenicity significantly, particularly after dose two. A significant NtAb response after dose one was only seen in CoVLP+AS03 groups. The vaccine dose had little impact on levels of NtAb responses achieved in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Both adjuvants also increased IFN{gamma} and IL-4 responses but these cellular responses also tended to be highest in the AS03-adjuvanted groups.

ConclusionCoVLP {+/-} adjuvants was well-tolerated. Several adjuvanted formulations elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after dose 2. Even at the lowest CoVLP+AS03 dose, NtAb titers were [~]10-times higher than in convalescent serum with a balanced IFN{gamma} and IL-4 response. These findings support the transition of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03) to further clinical evaluation.

Since that time, >150 candidate vaccines are reported to be under development of which 47 have entered clinical trials (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines accessed Nov 4, 2020). No vaccine to prevent COVID-19 has been licensed yet for either emergency or general use in North America or Europe. We searched PubMed for research articles published between July 2019 and November 4, 2020, using the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""vaccine"", ""clinical trial"" OR ""human"", AND ""phase"". The same terms were used to search ClinTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. We identified 10 peer-reviewed studies, describing phase 1 or 1/2 trials using a range of novel (eg: RNA, DNA, non-replicating virus vectored) and more traditional vaccine approaches (eg: inactivated virus or recombinant protein {+/-} adjuvants). None of these candidate vaccines was produced in plants. These reports demonstrate that several different vaccination strategies (typically delivered in two doses 14-28 days apart) are capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody responses. In several cases, vaccine-induced cellular responses against SARS-COV-2 antigens - predominantly the spike (S) protein - can also be demonstrated. Although local and systemic adverse events following vaccination have varied between reports, the trials published to date suggest that each of these candidate vaccines is well-tolerated in the context of an evolving pandemic.

Added value of this studyWe report the results of the first clinical study of CoVLP, a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that is produced by transient transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These VLPs spontaneously assemble at the plant cell membrane and display SARS-COV-2 trimers of stabilized pre-fusion S protein on their surface. The vaccine was administered as two intramuscular doses 21 days apart at three dose levels (S protein content 3.75, 7,5 or 15g) alone or adjuvanted with either CpG1018 or AS03. All formulations were well-tolerated although both adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Humoral (anti-S IgG and neutralizing antibodies) as well as cellular responses (IFNg and IL4 ELISpots) were detectable in almost all subjects who received adjuvanted formulations 21 days after the second dose at all COVLP dose levels. Both antibody and cellular responses were highest in subjects who received AS03-adjuvanted formulations. Even at the lowest dose level (3.75g), the neutralizing antibody titers 21 days after the second dose in subjects who received the AS03-afdjuvanted vaccine were 10-50-fold higher than those seen in subjects recovering from COVID-19 infection.

Implications of all the available evidenceEffective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to reduce the burden of disease and contribute to ending the global pandemic. Although no immune correlates for SARS-CoV-2 have been defined, it is likely that both arms of the immune system contribute to protection. After two doses of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03), strong humoral and cellular responses were induced supporting the further clinical development of this vaccine.",06/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.04.20226282,Nathalie Landry,Medicago inc.,medrxiv,pubmed,0,,
121,19338,"A first-in-human evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of SCB-2019, an adjuvanted, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein subunit vaccine for COVID-19 in healthy adults; a phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BackgroundAs part of the accelerated development of prophylactic vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) we report a first-in-human dose-finding and adjuvant justification study of SCB-2019, a novel protein subunit vaccine candidate composed of a stabilised trimeric form of the spike (S)-protein produced in CHO-cells, combined with two different adjuvants.

MethodsThis phase 1 study was done in one centre in Western Australia in 151 healthy adult volunteers in two age groups (18-54 and 55-75 years), allocated to 15 groups (nine young and six older adults) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, or 3 g, 9 g or 30 g SCB-2019, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding and ACE2-competitive binding IgG antibodies by ELISA, and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay; cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining.

FindingsWe report on 148 participants with at least 4 weeks follow-up post dose 2. Three participants withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated SAE (pituitary adenoma). Vaccination was well tolerated, with few Grade 3 solicited adverse events (AE). Most local AEs were mild injection site pain, which were more frequent with formulations containing AS03 than CpG/Alum or unadjuvanted SCB-2019. Systemic AEs, mostly transient headache, fatigue or myalgia, were more frequent in young adults than older adults after the first dose, but similar after second doses. Unadjuvanted SCB-2019 elicited minimal immune responses, but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of AS03 or CpG/Alum induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both young and older adults. Titres were higher than those observed in a panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera in all AS03 groups and high dose CpG/Alum groups. Both adjuvanted formulations elicited Th1-biased CD4+ T cell responses.

InterpretationSCB-2019 trimeric protein formulated with AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.

130,19585,BNT162b2 induces SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies and T cells in humans,"BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S) stabilized in the prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, we reported preliminary BNT162b2 safety and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 vaccine trial1. We present here antibody and T cell responses from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 19-55 years of age, after BNT162b2 prime/boost vaccination at 1 to 30 {micro}g dose levels. BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with S-binding IgG concentrations above those in a COVID-19 human convalescent sample (HCS) panel. Day 29 (7 days post-boost) SARS-CoV-2 serum 50% neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.3-fold (1 {micro}g) to 3.3-fold (30 {micro}g) those of the HCS panel. The BNT162b2-elicited sera neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Concurrently, in most participants, S-specific CD8+ and T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells had expanded, with a high fraction producing interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma}). Using peptide MHC multimers, the epitopes recognised by several BNT162b2-induced CD8+ T cells when presented on frequent MHC alleles were identified. CD8+ T cells were shown to be of the early-differentiated effector-memory phenotype, with single specificities reaching 0.01-3% of circulating CD8+ T cells. In summary, vaccination with BNT162b2 at well tolerated doses elicits a combined adaptive humoral and cellular immune response, which together may contribute to protection against COVID-19.",11/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.09.20245175,Ugur Sahin,BioNTech,medrxiv,pubmed,0,,
132,19793,"Safety and immunogenicity trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-BBV152: a phase 1, double-blind, randomised control trial","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a TLR 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG).

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind randomized controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152. A total of 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each) prepared with 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel, and an Algel only control arm (n=75). Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on day 0 (baseline) and day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity based on the anti-IgG S1 response (detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and wild-type virus neutralization [microneutralization and plaque reduction neutralization assays]). Cell-mediated responses were also evaluated.

ResultsReactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events. The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved. One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-g and 6-g Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype.

ConclusionsBBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2{degrees}C and 8{degrees}C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for the phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are underway.

139,20168,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein vaccine against COVID-19 in adults: pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials","BackgroundA safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.

MethodsWe did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085.

FindingsBetween June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 g or 50 g dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 g group) and 93% (the 50 g group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 g group and 117.8 for the 50 g group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 g group and 69.1 for the 50 g group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses. The 50 g group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 g group.

InterpretationThe protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 g vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

140,20174,"Safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 (a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial) and the persistence of immune responses from a phase 1 follow-up report","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 {micro}g or 6 {micro}g) formulated with a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG). Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152: 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG.

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion ([&ge;]4-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT50). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose).

FindingsAmong 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92{middle dot}9% (88{middle dot}2, 96{middle dot}2) and 98{middle dot}3% (95{middle dot}1, 99{middle dot}6) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6{middle dot}9, 13{middle dot}2) and 10.3% (7{middle dot}4, 13{middle dot}8) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73{middle dot}5% (63{middle dot}6, 81{middle dot}9), 81{middle dot}1% (71{middle dot}4, 88{middle dot}1), and 73{middle dot}1% (62{middle dot}9, 81{middle dot}8) of individuals in the 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 {micro}g with Algel groups, respectively.

InterpretationIn the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The safety profile of BBV152 is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates. The 6 {micro}g Algel-IMDG formulation was selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial.

CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion S protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression system. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations.

MethodsThis Phase I/II, randomised, double-blind study (NCT04537208) is being conducted in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18-49 and [&ge;]50 years) and randomised to receive one (on Day[D]1) or two doses (D1, D22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing: low-dose (LD, effective dose 1.3 {micro}g) or high-dose (HD, 2.6 {micro}g) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline); or unadjuvanted HD (18-49 years only). Safety was assessed up to D43. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising and binding antibody profiles were assessed in D1, D22 and D36 serum samples.

FindingsThe interim safety analyses included 439/441 randomised participants. There were no related unsolicited immediate AEs, serious AEs, medically attended AEs classified as severe, or AE of special interest. More grade 3 solicited reactions were reported than expected after the second dose in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising and binding antibody responses after two vaccine doses were higher in adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted groups, in AS03-versus AF03-adjuvanted groups, in HD versus LD groups, and in younger versus older age strata.

InterpretationThe lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age stratum, and the higher than anticipated reactogenicity post dose 2 were likely due to a higher than anticipated host cell protein content and lower than planned antigen dose in the clinical material. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.",20/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.19.20248611,Guy Debruyn,"Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA, USA",medrxiv,pubmed,0,,

MethodsIn this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (5 {micro}g recombinant spike protein with 50 {micro}g Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy [&ge;]7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants.

ResultsA total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX-CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative; 6% PLWH), there were 15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8). Efficacy in HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1), and did not differ by baseline serostatus. Of the primary endpoint cases with available whole genome sequencing, 38 (92.7%) of 41 were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: - 0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants. Among placebo recipients, the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 was similar in baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive participants during the first 2 months of follow-up (5.3% vs 5.2%). Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and higher with NVX-CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

ConclusionsThe NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant, while evidence of prior infection with the presumptive original SARS-CoV-2 did not confer protection against probable B.1.351 disease.

We report the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine, KCONVAC, in healthy adults.

MethodsTwo phase 1 and phase 2 randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials of KCONVAC were conducted in Chinese healthy adults aged 18 through 59 years. The phase 1 trial was conducted in a manner of dosage escalation. The first 30 participants were randomized in a ratio of 4:1 to receive two doses of either KCONVAC at 5 g per dose or placebo on Day 0 and Day 14, and the second 30 participants were randomized to receive either KCONVAC at 10 g per dose or placebo following the same procedures. The participants in the phase 2 trial were randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 to receive either KCONVAC at 5 g or 10 g per dose, or placebo on Day 0 and Day 14, or Day 0 and Day 28. In the phase 1 trial, the primary safety endpoint was the proportion of participants experiencing adverse reactions/events within 28 days following each vaccination. Antibody response and cellular response were assayed in the phase 1 trial. In the phase 2 trial, the primary immunogenicity endpoint was the seroconversion and titre of neutralization antibody, and the seroconversion of receptor binding domain (RBD)-IgG 28 days after the second dose.

FindingsIn the phase 1 trial, 60 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of 5-g vaccine (N=24), 10-g vaccine (N=24), or placebo (N=12). In the phase 2 trial, 500 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of 5-g vaccine (N=100 for 0/14 or 0/28 regimens), 10-g vaccine (N=100 for each regimen), or placebo (N=50 for each regimen). In the phase 1 trial, 13 (54%), 11(46%), and 7 (58%) participants reported at least one adverse event (AE), of whom 10 (42%), 6 (25%), and 6 (50%) participants reported at least one vaccination-related AE after receiving 5-g vaccine, 10-g vaccine, or placebo, respectively. In the phase 2 trial, 16 (16%), 19 (19%), and 9 (18%) participants reported at least one AE, of whom 13 (13%), 17 (17%), and 6 (12%) participants reported at least one vaccination-related AE after receiving 5-g vaccine, 10-g vaccine, or placebo at the regimen of Day 0/14, respectively. Similar results were observed in the three treatment groups of Day 0/28 regimen. All the AEs were grade 1 or 2 in intensity. No AE of grade 3 or more was reported. One SAE (foot fracture) was reported in the phase 1 trial. KCONVAC induced significant antibody response. 87{middle dot}5% (21/24) to 100% (24/24) of participants in the phase 1 trial and 83{middle dot}0% (83/100) to 100% (99/99) of participants in the phase 2 trial seroconverted for neutralising antibody to live virus, neutralising antibody to pseudovirus, and RBD-IgG after receiving two doses. Across the treatment groups in the two trials, the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of neutralising antibody to live virus ranged from 29{middle dot}3 to 49{middle dot}1 at Day 0/14 regimen and from 100{middle dot}2 to 131{middle dot}7 at Day 0/28 regimen, neutralising antibody to pseudovirus ranged from 69{middle dot}4 to 118{middle dot}7 at Day 0/14 regimen and from 153{middle dot}6 to 276{middle dot}6 at Day 0/28 regimen, and RBD-IgG ranged from 605{middle dot}3 to 1169{middle dot}8 at Day 0/14 regimen and from 1496{middle dot}8 to 2485{middle dot}5 at Day 0/28 regimen. RBD-IgG subtyping assay showed that a significant part of RBD-IgG was IgG1. The vaccine induced obvious T-cell response with 56{middle dot}5% (13/23) and 62{middle dot}5% (15/24) of participants in 5-g and 10-g vaccine groups showed positive interferon-{gamma} enzyme-linked immunospot responses 14 days after the second dose in the phase 1 trial, respectively.

InterpretationKCONVAC is well tolerated and able to induce robust antibody response and cellular response in adults aged 18 to 59 years, which warrants further evaluation with this vaccine in the upcoming phase 3 efficacy trial.

295,27712,"Safety, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy of a COVID-19 Vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) Co-administered With Seasonal Influenza Vaccines","BackgroundThe safety and immunogenicity profile of COVID-19 vaccines when administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccines has not yet been reported.

MethodsA sub-study on influenza vaccine co-administration was conducted as part of the phase 3 randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373. The first [~]400 participants meeting main study entry criteria and with no contraindications to influenza vaccination were invited to join the sub-study. After randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive NVX-CoV2373 (n=217) or placebo (n=214), sub-study participants received an age-appropriate, licensed, open-label influenza vaccine with dose 1 of NVX-CoV2373. Reactogenicity was evaluated via electronic diary for 7 days post-vaccination in addition to monitoring for unsolicited adverse events (AEs), medically-attended AEs (MAAEs), and serious AEs (SAEs). Influenza haemagglutination inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG assays were performed. Vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed. Comparisons were made between sub-study and main study participants.

FindingsSub-study participants were younger, more racially diverse, and had fewer comorbid conditions than main study participants. Reactogenicity events more common in the co-administration group included tenderness (70.1% vs 57.6%) or pain (39.7% vs 29.3%) at injection site, fatigue (27.7% vs 19.4%), and muscle pain (28.3% vs 21.4%). Rates of unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, and SAEs were low and balanced between the two groups. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune response, while a reduction in antibody responses to the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was noted. Vaccine efficacy in the sub-study was 87.5% (95% CI: -0.2, 98.4) while efficacy in the main study was 89.8% (95% CI: 79.7, 95.5).

InterpretationThis is the first study to demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with seasonal influenza vaccines. The results suggest concomitant vaccination may be a viable immunisation strategy.

FundingThis study was funded by Novavax, Inc.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles published from December 2019 until 1 April 2021 with no language restrictions for the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""vaccine"", ""co-administration"", and ""immunogenicity"". There were no peer-reviewed publications describing the simultaneous use of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and another vaccine. Several vaccine manufacturers had recent publications on phase 3 trials results (Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology). Neither these publications nor their clinical trials protocols (when publicly available) described co-administration and they often had trial criteria specifically excluding those with recent or planned vaccination with any licenced vaccine near or at the time of any study injection.

Added value of this studyImmune interference and safety are always a concern when two vaccines are administered at the same time. This is the first study to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity profile and clinical vaccine efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with a seasonal influenza vaccine.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study provides much needed information to help guide national immunisation policy decision making on the critical issue of concomitant use of COVID-19 vaccines with influenza vaccines.",13/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.09.21258556,Paul Heath,"St Georges, University of London",medrxiv,pubmed,0,,
231,24845,First-in-Human Trial of a Recombinant Stabilized Prefusion SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Vaccine with Adjuvant of Aluminum Hydroxide and CpG 1018,"DesignThis is a phase 1, dose-escalation open-label trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901, a recombinant stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P) protein vaccine with adjuvant of aluminum hydroxide and CpG 1018.

MethodsWe enrolled 45 healthy adults from 20 to 49 years of age to be administered with two vaccinations of MVC-COV1901 in a low dose (LD), middle dose (MD), and high dose (HD) of spike protein at 28 days apart. There were 15 participants in each dose group, and all of them were followed up for 28 days after the second vaccination at the time of interim analysis. Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory data were recorded for safety evaluation. Blood samples were collected for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and pseudovirus neutralization assays as well as SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) at various times. Overall, the study duration will be 7 months.

ResultsSolicited events were mostly mild and similar in the participants of all three dose groups. No subject experienced fever. There were no serious nor adverse events of special interest at the time point of this interim report. After the second vaccination, the SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG titers increased with peak geometric mean titers at 7178.245 (LD), 7746.086 (MD), and 11220.58 (HD), respectively. Serum neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants of MD and HD groups, with geometric mean values generally comparable to those of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. All of the participants in the MD and HD groups were seroconverted after the second vaccination.

ConclusionsThe MVC-COV1901 vaccine is safe and elicits remarkable immune responses especially in the MD and HD groups.

196,23525,COVID-19 vaccine response in pregnant and lactating women: a cohort study,"BackgroundPregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial COVID-19 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision-making are lacking. We sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women.

Methods131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131), umbilical cord sera (N=10), and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, 2nd vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post 2nd vaccine, and delivery by Luminex, and confirmed by ELISA. Titers were compared to pregnant women 4-12 weeks from native infection (N=37). Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups.

ResultsVaccine-induced immune responses were equivalent in pregnant and lactating vs non-pregnant women. All titers were higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, but not IgA, increased in maternal blood and breastmilk with vaccine boost. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placental and breastmilk.",08/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.07.21253094,Galit Alter,"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA",medrxiv,Pregnant cohort,0,,
178,22855,Real-time analysis of a mass vaccination effort confirms the safety of FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNtech,"As the COVID-19 vaccination campaign unfolds as one of the most rapid and widespread in history, it is important to continuously assess the real world safety of the FDA-authorized vaccines. Curation from large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) allows for near real-time safety evaluations that were not previously possible. Here, we advance context- and sentiment-aware deep neural networks over the multi-state Mayo Clinic enterprise (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin) for automatically curating the adverse effects mentioned by physicians in over 108,000 EHR clinical notes between December 1st 2020 to February 8th 2021. We retrospectively compared the clinical notes of 31,069 individuals who received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine to those of 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who were propensity matched by demographics, residential location, and history of prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. We find that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were seen in the the clinic at similar rates within 21 days of the first or second actual or assigned vaccination dose (first dose Odds Ratio = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09-1.16; second dose Odds Ratio = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Further, the incidence rates of all surveyed adverse effects were similar or lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals after either vaccine dose. Finally, the most frequently documented adverse effects within 7 days of each vaccine dose were arthralgia (Dose 1: 0.59%; Dose 2: 0.39%), diarrhea (Dose 1: 0.58%; Dose 2: 0.33%), erythema (Dose 1: 0.51%; Dose 2: 0.31%), myalgia (Dose 1: 0.40%; Dose 2: 0.34%), and fever (Dose 1: 0.27%; Dose 2: 0.31%). These remarkably low frequencies of adverse effects recorded in EHRs versus those derived from active solicitation during clinical trials (arthralgia: 24-46%; erythema: 9.5-14.7%; myalgia: 38-62%; fever: 14.2-15.5%) emphasize the rarity of vaccine-associated adverse effects requiring clinical attention.

We thus evaluated post-mRNA vaccination adverse events (AE) in 246 vaccinated adults with IBD participating in a longitudinal vaccine registry. In general, AE frequency was similar to that reported in the general population. As in the general population, AE were more common among younger patients, and those with prior COVID-19.

217,24131,Evaluating the neutralizing ability of a CpG-adjuvanted S-2P subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern,"Vaccination is currently the best weapon to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, an alarming number of novel variants termed Variants of Concern (VoC) were found to harbor mutations that diminished the neutralizing capacity of antibodies elicited by the vaccines. We have investigated the neutralizing titers of antibodies from sera of humans and rats immunized with the MVC-COV1901 vaccine against pseudoviruses coated with the wildtype, D614G, B.1.1.7, or B.1.351 spike proteins. Rats vaccinated with two doses of adjuvanted S-2P retained neutralization activities against the B.1.351 variant, albeit with a slight reduction compared to wildtype. Phase 1 vaccinated subjects showed more reduced neutralization abilities against the B.1.351 variant. The study is among the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate dose-dependent neutralizing responses against VoCs, particularly against B.1.351, from different doses of antigen in a clinical trial for a subunit protein COVID-19 vaccine. The appearance of vaccine escape variants is a growing concern facing many current COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Strategies should be adopted against the ever-changing nature of these variants.

330,29213,"Virus neutralizing antibody responses after two doses of BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, Beijing CNBG) vaccine","BackgroundLimited information is available on the effectiveness of the BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, Beijing CNBG) vaccine, especially in the elderly, despite the fact that it is approved in more than 50 countries.

MethodsVirus neutralizing antibody titres, as a rapidly available but highly predictive surrogate marker, were measured after two doses of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine in 450 subjects. Results were analyzed in a multivariable model accounting for age, sex and time since the administration of the second dose of the vaccine.

FindingsSex and time since the second dose had little association with the antibody titres. Age, however, was highly relevant: measurable antibody levels were present in about 90% of individuals below the age of 50, but antibody production after BBIBP-CorV vaccination was strongly reduced with increasing age. A large number of elderly subjects, reaching 25% at 60 years, and up to 50% at ages over 80, were found not to produce any protective antibody.

InterpretationNeutralizing antibody titre, as a correlate of protection for COVID-19 disease susceptibility, should help to evaluate the effectiveness of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Results suggest that proper measures should be undertaken to prevent a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in BBIBP-CorV vaccinated but eventually unprotected elderly individuals.

FundingNo specific funding was used to carry out the study.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, Beijing CNBG) vaccine was found to be effective, but the Phase 3 trial included few women, almost no elderly subject and no subject with preexisting medical condition. It is therefore especially important to monitor the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine, however when searching Pubmed for (Sinopharm OR BBIBP-CorV) AND vaccine AND (effectiveness OR efficacy OR antibody OR titre) in text words with no language or date restriction and translation of the terms, we found no such published study. The most rapid way to generate such evidence is the assessment of antibody response which was found to be highly predictive for disease susceptibility. This is of crucial importance as the vaccine is approved in more than 50 countries, and hundreds of millions have already been vaccinated with many planned to be vaccinated in the near future with this vaccine.

Added value of this studyVirus neutralizing antibody titres were measured after two doses of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine in 450 subjects. Results were analyzed in a multivariable model accounting for age, sex and time since the administration of the second dose of the vaccine. We found that sex and time since the second dose had little association with the antibody titres. Age, however, was highly relevant: while the vast majority of those below 50 years had measurable antibody levels, this rate quickly dropped with increasing age. In subjects aged 60 years, quarter, in those above 80 almost half had no detectable neutralizing antibody.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe real-world effectiveness of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine should be carefully monitored. Elderly subjects are especially prone to produce no protective antibody after vaccination. This should be monitored, and proper measures should be undertaken to prevent a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in BBIBP-CorV vaccinated but eventually unprotected elderly individuals.",19/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.15.21260362,Balázs Sarkadi,"Institute of Enzymology, ELKH Research Centre for Natural Sciences",medrxiv,Observational immunogenicity,0,,
338,29306,Longitudinal analysis of antibody responses to the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine in Patients Undergoing Maintenance Hemodialysis,"Background and objectivesPatients undergoing hemodialysis are at higher risk of developing severe complications upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and were prioritized in the Portuguese vaccination campaign. Immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in hemodialyzed patients was not addressed by the phase 3 clinical trials leading to their emergency approval.

Design, setting, participants, and measurementsWe performed a prospective, longitudinal, cohort analysis of 156 hemodialyzed patients and 143 age-matched controls scheduled for BTN162b2 vaccine. Excluded from analysis were five patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, three sero-positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 N, two dropouts and two deaths. ELISA was used to quantify anti-full-length Spike IgG, IgM and IgA levels in sera collected at day of the first vaccine dose (t0); 3 weeks later (day of the second dose, t1); and 3 weeks after the second inoculation (t2).

ResultsSeroconversion after the first vaccine dose (t1) was remarkably low in patients, with positivity for anti-spike IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies of 29.4%, 12% and 41%, respectively. The second vaccine dose raised seroconversion to 90.9% and 83.9% for IgG and IgA, respectively, while IgM positivity remained unchanged. At t1 the anti-Spike IgG level was significantly lower in patients with ages below 70 years when compared to age-matched controls, showing a profile similar to aged individuals (above 70 years). Immunosuppression was associated with lower antibody responses along the vaccine schedule (p=0.005 at t1; p=0.008 at t2). Noteworthy, previous unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination (75/129, 58% of patients negative for anti-HBs antibodies) did not correlate with humoral unresponsiveness to BTN162b2. Other clinical and laboratory parameters had marginal correlations with response to vaccination.

ConclusionsThe large majority of hemodialyzed patients showed IgG seroconversion upon BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination but a sizable proportion of patients presented poor responses.

325,28562,Humoral and cellular responses to mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV2 in patients with a history of CD20-B-cell depleting therapy,"BackgroundB-cell depleting therapies increase COVID19 morbidity and mortality. For this specific population, evidence-based vaccination strategies are lacking. Here, we investigated humoral and cell mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV2 mRNA-based vaccines in patients receiving CD20-B-cell depleting agents for autoimmune disease, malignancy, or transplantation.

MethodsPatients at the Bern University Hospital with a treatment history of anti-CD20 depleting agents (rituximab or ocrelizumab) were enrolled for analysis of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (by interferon-{gamma} release assay) after completing vaccination against SARS-CoV2. Primary outcome was the the anti-spike antibody response in anti-CD20-treated patients (n=96) in comparison to immunocompetent controls (n=29).

ResultsAnti-spike IgG antibodies were detected in 49% of patients 1.79 months after the second vaccine dose (interquartile range, IQR: 1.16-2.48) compared to 100% of controls (p<0.001). SARS-CoV2 specific interferon-{gamma} release was detected in 17% of patients and 86% of healthy controls (p<0.001). Only 5% of patients, but 86% of healthy controls showed positive reactions in both assays, respectively (p<0.001). Time since last anti-CD20 therapy (7.6 months), peripheral CD19+ (>27/{micro}l), and CD4+ lymphocyte count (>653/{micro}l) predicted humoral vaccine response (area under the curve [AUC]: 62% [CI 56-78], 67% [CI 58-80] and 67% [CI 54-79], (positive predictive value [PPV]: 0.76, 0.7 and 0.71).

ConclusionThis study provides evidence for blunted humoral and cell-mediated immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines in patients with CD20-depleting treatment history.

211,23967,Interim results of the safety and immune-efficacy of 1 versus 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 for cancer patients in the context of the UK vaccine priority guidelines,"BackgroundThe efficacy and safety profile of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been definitively established in immunocompromised patient populations. Patients with a known cancer diagnosis were hitherto excluded from trials of the vaccines currently in clinical use.

MethodsThis study presents data on the safety and immune efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in 54 healthy controls and 151 mostly elderly patients with solid and haematological malignancies, respectively, and compares results for patients who were boosted with BNT162b2 at 3 weeks versus those who were not. Immune efficacy was measured as antibody seroconversion, T cell responses, and neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and of a variant of concern (VOC) (B.1.1.7). We also collected safety data for the BNT162b2 vaccine up to 5 weeks following first dose.

FindingsThe vaccine was largely well tolerated. However, in contrast to its very high performance in healthy controls (>90% efficacious), immune efficacy of a single inoculum in solid cancer patients was strikingly low (below 40%) and very low in haematological cancer patients (below 15%). Of note, efficacy in solid cancer patients was greatly and rapidly increased by boosting at 21-days (95% within 2 weeks of boost). Too few haematological cancer patients were boosted for clear conclusions to be drawn.

ConclusionsDelayed boosting potentially leaves most solid and haematological cancer patients wholly or partially unprotected, with implications for their own health; their environment and the evolution of VOC strains. Prompt boosting of solid cancer patients quickly overcomes the poor efficacy of the primary inoculum in solid cancer patients.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSome cancer patients have been shown to exhibit sustained immune dysregulation, inefficient seroconversion and prolonged viral shedding as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Consequently, their exclusion and, in particular, the exclusion of patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapies, from the registry trials of the 5 approved COVID-19 vaccines raises questions about the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in this patient population. In addition, whilst the change in the UKs dosing interval to 12-weeks aimed to maximise population coverage, it is unclear whether this strategy is appropriate for cancer patients and those on systemic anti-cancer therapies.

Added value of this studyWe report that the RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine administered in cancer patients was well tolerated, and we provide first insights into both antibody and T cell responses to the vaccine in an immunocompromised patient population.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn cancer patients, one dose of 30ug of BNT162b2 yields poor vaccine efficacy, as measured by seroconversion rates, viral neutralisation capacity and T cell responses, at 3- and 5-weeks following the first inoculum. Patients with solid cancers exhibited a significantly greater response following a booster at 21-days. These data support prioritisation of cancer patients for an early (21-day) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Given the globally poor responses to vaccination in patients with haematological cancers, post-vaccination serological testing, creation of herd immunity around these patients using a strategy of  ring vaccination, and careful follow-up should be prioritised.",17/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.17.21253131,Sheeba Irshad,"Comprehensive Cancer Centre, School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kings College London, London, UK / Breast Cancer Now Research Unit, Kings College Londo",medrxiv,Observational immunogenicity,0,,
212,24023,Serological response to COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients receiving biologics,"ObjectiveThe impact of medications on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in IBD patients is unknown, as patients with immunosuppressed states and/or treated with immunosuppressants were excluded from vaccine trials. To address this, we evaluated serological responses to COVID-19 vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (NIH-Moderna) vaccines in IBD patients enrolled in an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sero-survey at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

DesignWe obtained sera from 48 patients who had undergone vaccination with one or two vaccine doses. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and IgG (Siemens COV2T and sCOVG assays), anti-Spike IgG (in-house ELISA), and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (Roche).

ResultsAll IBD patients (15/15) who completed two-dose vaccine schedules achieved seroconversion to high levels. Two IBD patients with history of COVID-19 infections and who were seropositive at baseline seroconverted to high levels after the first dose. Concurrent biologic use was 85% (41/48), including 33% of patients (16) on TNF antagonist monotherapy, 42% (17) on vedolizumab monotherapy, 6% (3) on vedolizumab combination therapy with thiopurine, and 8% (4) ustekinumab; 1 patient was receiving guselkumab for psoriasis. Three patients (6%) were on oral steroids at the time of vaccination.

ConclusionIBD patients receiving biologics can seroconvert with robust serological responses after complete Pfizer-BioNTech and NIH-Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. In IBD-patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, a single dose of either vaccine can induce high index values, mirroring findings from the general population.",20/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.17.21253848,Serre-Yu Wong,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,medrxiv,Observational immunogenicity,0,,
222,24587,Infliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"BackgroundDelayed second-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination trades maximal effectiveness for a lower level of immunity across more of the population. We investigated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses to a single-dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsAntibody responses and seroconversion rates in infliximab-treated patients (n=865) were compared to a cohort treated with vedolizumab (n=428), a gut-selective anti-integrin 4{beta}7 monoclonal antibody. Our primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations 3-10 weeks after vaccination in patients without evidence of prior infection. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion rates, and antibody responses following past infection or a second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

FindingsGeometric mean [SD] anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were lower in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following BNT162b2 (6{middle dot}0 U/mL [5{middle dot}9] vs 28{middle dot}8 U/mL [5{middle dot}4] P<0{middle dot}0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4{middle dot}7 U/mL [4{middle dot}9]) vs 13{middle dot}8 U/mL [5{middle dot}9] P<0{middle dot}0001) vaccines. In our multivariable models, antibody concentrations were lower in infliximab- compared to vedolizumab-treated patients who received the BNT162b2 (fold change [FC] 0{middle dot}29 [95% CI 0{middle dot}21, 0{middle dot}40], p<0{middle dot}0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (FC 0{middle dot}39 [95% CI 0{middle dot}30, 0{middle dot}51], p<0{middle dot}0001) vaccines. In both models, age [&ge;] 60 years, immunomodulator use, Crohns disease, and smoking were associated with lower, whilst non-white ethnicity was associated with higher, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations. Seroconversion rates after a single-dose of either vaccine were higher in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine.

InterpretationInfliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to a single-dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a second dose of vaccine, led to seroconversion in most patients. Delayed second dosing should be avoided in patients treated with infliximab.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSFaced with further surges of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a growing number of countries, including the UK, have opted to delay second vaccine doses for all people. This strategy trades maximal effectiveness against a lower level of protective immunity across more of the at-risk population.

We have previously shown that seroprevalence, seroconversion in PCR-confirmed cases, and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection are reduced in infliximab compared with vedolizumab-treated patients. Whether single-doses of vaccines are effective in patients treated with anti-TNF therapies is unknown.

We searched PubMed from 25 November 2019 to 23 March 2021 with the terms ""anti-tumour necrosis factor"" or ""anti-integrin"" or ""infliximab"" or ""adalimumab"" or ""vedolizumab"" or ""biological therapy"" or ""biologic therapy"" AND ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""coronavirus"" or ""COVID-19"" or AND ""seroprevalence"" or ""seroconversion"" or ""antibody"" or ""antibody response"" or ""magnitude"" or ""immunogenicity"" AND ""vaccine"" or ""vaccination"" or ""immunisation"" or ""immunization"" or ""ChAdOx1 nCoV-19"" or ""BNT162b2"" or ""mRNA-1273"", without restriction on language.

Serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been reported in registration trials and small observational cohorts of healthy volunteers. Two small studies, including one unpublished preprint, found that COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity rates were lower in transplant recipients and patients with malignancy receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and fewer patients treated with potent immunosuppressants seroconverted than healthy controls. No studies have assessed the effect of anti-TNF therapy on immunogenicity following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Added value of this studyTo test if anti-TNF drugs attenuate serological responses to primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we analysed anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations and seroconversion rates in 1293 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received primary vaccinations with either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccines. 865 were treated with the anti-TNF drug infliximab and outcomes were compared to a reference cohort of 428 patients treated with vedolizumab, a gut selective anti-integrin 4{beta}7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired systemic immune responses.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and rates of seroconversion were lower following primary vaccination with both the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines in patients with IBD treated with infliximab compared to vedolizumab. Older age, immunomodulator use, Crohns disease (versus ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease unclassified), and current smoking were associated with lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations, irrespective of vaccine type. Non- white ethnicity was associated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S) antibody concentrations following primary vaccination with both vaccines. Antibody concentrations and seroconversion rates were higher in patients with past SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to a single-dose of either vaccine, and after 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

Implications of the available evidenceOur findings have important implications for patients treated with anti-TNF therapy, particularly for those also treated with an immunomodulator. Poor antibody responses to a single-dose of vaccine exposes these patients to a potential increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, higher rates of seroconversion in patients with two exposures to SARS-CoV-2 antigen, even in the presence of TNF blockade, suggest that all patients receiving these drugs should be prioritized for optimally timed second doses. Until patients receive a second vaccine dose, they should consider that they are not protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and continue to practice enhanced physical distancing and shielding if appropriate. Even after two antigen exposures, a small subset of patients failed to mount an antibody response. Antibody testing and adapted vaccine schedules should be considered to protect these at-risk patients.",29/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.25.21254335,Tariq Ahmad,Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust,medrxiv,Observational immunogenicity,0,,
232,24833,"Humoral response to Pfizer mRNA vaccine against SARS CoV2, in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and the impact on the rheumatic disease activity","BackgroundThe registration trials of mRNA vaccines against SARS CoV2 did not address patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatoid diseases (AIRD).

AimsTo assess the humoral response to mRNA vaccine against SARS CoV2, in AIRD patients treated with immunomodulating drugs and the impact on AIRD activity.

MethodsConsecutive patients treated at the rheumatology institute who received their first SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer) vaccine were recruited to the study, at their routine visit. The patients were invited for serology test 4-6 weeks after receiving the second dose of vaccine. IgG Antibodies (Ab) against SARS COV2 virus were detected using the SARS-Cov-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott) assay

ResultsOne hundred fifty-six consecutive patients (76% females) treated at a single rheumatology center (mean age (range) 59.1 (21-83) years), mean (range) disease duration 10.8 (1-55) years), were recruited to the study. Thirty-five percents of patients received conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs only, 64% biological/targeted synthetic (b/ts) DMARDs, 34% received combined treatment with csDMARDs and b/tsDMARDs and 32% corticosteroids (mean dose(range) 5.8mg(2.5-20mg) prednisone). One hundred thirty-seven patients (88%) were seropositive for IgG Ab against SARS CoV2 virus (median 2832.5 AU/ml, range 58-29499). Nineteen (12%) patients had negative tests, 11/19 were treated with B cell depleting agents. The reported side effects of the vaccine were minor (muscle sore, headache, low grade fever). The rheumatic disease remained stable in all patients.

ConclusionsThe vast majority of AIRD patients developed a significant humoral response following the administration of the second dose of the Pfeizer mRNA vaccine against SARS CoV2 virus.

234,24932,Quantification of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk of lactating women vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine,"The recent approval of vaccines against COVID-19 has generated great concern among breastfeeding women, since these patients were excluded from vaccination clinical trials. The present study aimed to analyze the levels of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk of mRNA-vaccinated women across time and their correlation with serum antibody levels.

Methodsprospective study including lactating women aged over 18 who were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 with the Pfizer-BioNTech(R) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2). Paired serum and breast milk samples were simultaneously taken from each participant at three timepoints after receiving the vaccine: 2 weeks after 1st dose, 2 weeks after 2nd dose and 4 weeks after 2nd dose (Timepoints 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Levels of IgG antibodies against the spike protein (S1 subunit) were determined for each sample (Architect, Abbott(R)).

Resultswe collected and analyzed 52 serum and 52 milk samples from the first 18 study participants. Median (interquartile range) IgG(S1) levels for serum - milk pairs at each timepoint were 410 (208-606) - 1.7 (0-2.9) AU/ml at Timepoint 1, 11505 (8933 - 21184) - 52.2 (34.1-113) at Timepoint 2 and 8311 (5578-17419) - 41.7 (24.8-75.3) at Timepoint 3. Pearsons correlation coefficient between breast milk and serum IgG(S1) levels was 0.71. No major adverse reactions were observed in mothers or infants.

ConclusionsBreast milk from women vaccinated with mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech(R) vaccine contains specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG(S1) antibodies, with levels increasing considerably after second dose.

240,25195,Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in Dialysis,"BackgroundPatients receiving maintenance dialysis represent a high risk, immune-compromised population with 15-25% COVID mortality rate who were unrepresented in clinical trials evaluated for mRNA vaccines emergency use authorization.

MethodAll patients receiving maintenance dialysis that received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines with antibody test results drawn [&ge;]14 days after the second dose, as documented in the electronic health record through March 18, 2021 were included. We report seroresponse based on levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (seropositive [&ge;]2) using FDA-approved semi-quantitative chemiluminescent assay (ADVIA Centaur(R) XP/XPT COV2G).

ResultsAmong 186 dialysis patients from 32 clinics in 8 states tested 23{+/-}8 days after receiving 2 vaccine doses, mean age was 68{+/-}12 years, with 47% women, 21% Black, 26% residents in long-term care facilities and 97% undergoing in-center hemodialysis. Overall seropositive rate was 165/186 (88.7%) with 70% at maximum titer and with no significant difference in seropositivity between BNT162b2/Pfizer (N=148) and mRNA-1273/Moderna (N=18) vaccines (88.1% vs. 94.4%, p=0.42). Among patients with COVID-19 history, seropositive rate was 38/38 (100%) with 97% at maximum titer.

ConclusionMost patients receiving maintenance dialysis were seropositive after two doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine. Early evidence suggests that vaccinated dialysis patients with prior COVID-19 develop robust antibody response. These results support an equitable and aggressive vaccination strategy for eligible dialysis patients, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, to prevent the extremely high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in this high risk population.

SignificanceIn this retrospective observational evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response defined by detectable levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen of [&ge;]2 in serum of patients receiving maintenance dialysis, 165/186 (88.7%) were found to be seropositive (with 70% at maximum titer) at least 14 days after completing the second dose. No significant differences were observed by race or other subgroup or by vaccine manufacturer. Therefore, an equitable and aggressive vaccination strategy for all eligible maintenance dialysis patients, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, is warranted to prevent the extremely high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in this high risk population.",13/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.08.21254779,Eduardo Lacson Jr.,Dialysis Clinic Inc./Tufts Medical Center,medrxiv,Observational immunogenicity,0,,
251,25812,Declined antibody responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within first three months,"BackgroundThe mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have proven highly effective and are currently used to vaccinate all age groups against COVID-19. Despite their high efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on the impact of age, sex, and side effects on vaccine-induced immune responses.

MethodsWe here studied the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain antibodies after two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 healthy volunteers and correlated their immune response with age, sex, and side effects reported after the vaccinations.

FindingsOur findings show a robust immune response to the Spike proteins RBD region after the first and the second vaccination dose. However, we also saw a decline of antibody levels at 6 weeks versus 1 week after the second dose, suggesting a waning of the immune response over time. Regardless of this, the antibody levels at 6 weeks after the second dose remained significantly higher than before the vaccination, after the first dose, or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, and that mRNA vaccination is less efficient in older males whereas the detrimental impact of age on vaccination outcome is abolished in females at 6 weeks after the second dose.

InterpretationThe Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induces a strong immune response after two doses of vaccination but older individuals develop fewer side effects and decreased antibody levels at 6 weeks. The waning of anti-viral antibodies in particular in older male individuals suggests that both age and male sex act as risk factors in the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.

FundingThe study was supported by the Centre of Excellence in Translational Genomics (EXCEGEN), and the Estonian Research Council grant PRG377 and SYNLAB Estonia.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe first studies addressing the immune responses in older individuals after the single-dose administration of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have been published. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for publications on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines, published in English, using the search terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""vaccine response"", ""mRNA vaccine"", up to April 15th, 2021. To date, most mRNA vaccine response studies have not been peer-reviewed, and data on the role of age, sex and side effects on SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines in real vaccination situations is limited. Some studies have found a weaker immune response in older individuals after the first dose and these have been measured at a relatively short period (within 1-2 weeks) after the first dose but little longer-term evidence exists on the postvaccination antibody persistence. Even less information is available on sex differences or correlations with mRNA vaccine side effects.

Added value of this studyIn this study, we assessed the antibody response up to 6 weeks after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 individuals. Our findings show a strong initial immune response after the first dose and an even higher Spike RBD antibody levels at 1 week after the second dose, but these significantly declined at 6 weeks after the second dose. We also found a weaker immune response and faster waning of antibodies in older vaccinated individuals, which correlated with fewer side effects at the time of vaccinations. Furthermore, although overall female and male vaccinees responded similarly, we found that age-related waning of the vaccine-related antibodies was stronger amongst older males whereas in females the impact of age was lost at 6 weeks after the second dose.

Implications of all the available evidenceNew mRNA vaccines are now applied worldwide as they have shown high efficacy in clinical trials. Our results show that two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induce a strong antibody response to Spike RBD region but these high levels decline 1.5 months after the second dose in most of the vaccinated individuals. Nevertheless, even at 6 weeks after the second dose, they stay significantly higher than at prevaccination, after the first dose of vaccine, or in Covid-19 postinfection. These findings also implicate that fewer adverse effects may indicate lower antibody response after the vaccination and point to the need for more individualized vaccination protocols, in particular among older people.",25/05/2021,10.1101/2021.04.19.21255714,Paul Naaber,SYNLAB Eesti; University of Tartu,medrxiv,Observational immunogenicity,0,,
260,25935,BNT162b2 vaccination induces SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody secretion into human milk with minimal transfer of vaccine mRNA,"ImportanceTo examine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of lactating mothers on human milk

Objective(1) To quantify SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in human milk of lactating mothers who received the BNT162b2 vaccine, with reference to a cohort convalescent from antenatal COVID-19, and healthy lactating mothers. (2) To detect and quantify vaccine mRNA in human milk after BNT162b2 vaccination.

DesignGestational Immunity For Transfer 2 (GIFT-2) is a prospective cohort study of lactating mothers who were due to receive two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, recruited between 5th February 2021 and 9th February 2021.

SettingLactating healthcare workers living in Singapore

ParticipantsConvenience sample of ten lactating healthcare workers. Human milk samples were collected at four time points: pre-vaccination, 1-3 days after dose one, 7-10 days after dose one, and 3-7 days after dose two of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

ExposureTwo doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine 21 days apart.

Main Outcome and Measure(i) SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG in human milk of lactating mothers who received BNT162b2 vaccine, (ii) Detection and quantification of vaccine mRNA in human milk after BNT162b2 vaccination.

ResultsTen lactating healthcare workers aged 32.5 years (range 29 - 42) were recruited, with 40 human milk samples collected and analysed. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA was predominant in human milk of lactating mothers who received BNT162b2 vaccine. The sharpest rise in antibody production was 3 -7 days after dose two of the BNT162b2 vaccine, with medians of 1110 picomolar of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike and 374 picomolar of anti-Receptor Binding Domain IgA. Vaccine mRNA was detected only on rare occasions, at a maximum concentration of 2 ng/mL.

Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cohort of ten lactating mothers following BNT162b2 vaccination, nine (90%) produced SARS-CoV-2 IgA, and ten (100%) produced IgG in human milk with minimal amounts of vaccine mRNA. Lactating individuals should continue breastfeeding in an uninterrupted manner after receiving mRNA vaccination for SARS-CoV-2.

We evaluated immune responses to the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine in solid tumor patients (n=52) on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy. These responses were compared to a control cohort that also received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (n=50). Using live SARS-CoV-2 assays, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67% and 80% of cancer patients after the first and second immunizations, respectively, with a 3-fold increase in median titers after the booster. Similar trends were observed in serum antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 regions of Spike protein, and in IFN{gamma}+ Spike-specific T cells. The magnitude of each of these responses was diminished relative to the control cohort. We therefore quantified RBD- and Spike S1-specific memory B cell subsets as predictors of anamnestic responses to viral exposures or additional immunizations. After the second vaccination, Spike-specific plasma cell-biased memory B cells were observed in most cancer patients at levels similar to those of the control cohort after the first immunization. These data suggest that a third immunization might elevate antibody responses in cancer patients to levels seen in healthy individuals after the second dose.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the impact of different COVID-19 vaccines on specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG levels in human milk.

Design, Settings and ParticipantsIn this prospective observational study in Spain, 75 lactating women from priority groups receiving vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were included (January to April 2021). Human milk samples were collected at seven-time points. A group with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=19) and a group of women from prepandemic time (n=13) were included.

ExposuremRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) and adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19).

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Presence of IgA and IgG against RBD SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk.

ResultsSeventy-five vaccinated lactating women [mean age, 34.9 {+/-} 3.7 years] of whom 96% were Caucasic and 92% were health care workers. A total of 417 milk samples were included and vaccine distribution was BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2, n=30), Moderna (mRNA-1273, n=21), and AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, n=24). For each vaccine, 7 time points were collected from baseline up to 25 days after the 1st dose and same points were collected for mRNA vaccines 30 days after 2nd dose. A strong reactivity was observed for IgG and IgA after vaccination mainly after the 2nd dose. Presence and the persistence of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk were dependent on the vaccine-type and, on previous virus exposure. High inter-variability was observed, being relevant for IgA antibodies. IgG levels were significantly higher than those observed in milk from COVID-19 women while IgA levels were lower. Women with previous COVID-19 increased the IgG levels after the 1st dose to a similar level observed in vaccinated women after the 2nd dose.

Conclusions and RelevanceBreast milk from vaccinated women contains anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG, with highest after the 2nd dose. Levels were dependent on vaccine type and previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Previous COVID-19 influenced the vaccine effect after a single dose, which could be especially relevant in the design of vaccination protocols. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate the potential protective role of these antibodies against COVID-19 in infants from vaccinated and infected mothers through breastfeeding.

Randomized controlled trials for COVID-19 vaccines included few patients with kidney disease, therefore vaccine immunogenicity is uncertain in this population.

ObjectiveEvaluate the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in chronic hemodialysis patients following one versus two doses of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination compared to health care worker controls and convalescent serum.

DesignProspective observational cohort study.

SettingSingle centre study in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Participants142 in-centre hemodialysis patients and 35 health care worker controls.

ExposureBNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to the spike protein (anti-spike), receptor binding domain (anti-RBD), and nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) were measured in 66 hemodialysis patients receiving one vaccine dose following a public health policy change, 76 patients receiving two vaccine doses, and 35 health care workers receiving two vaccine doses.

ResultsDetectable anti-NP suggestive of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 15/142 (11%) of patients at baseline while only three patients had prior RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Two additional patients contracted COVID-19 after receiving two doses of vaccine. In patients receiving a single BNT162b2 dose, seroconversion occurred in 53/66 (80%) for anti-spike and 35/66 (55%) for anti-RBD by 28 days post dose, but only 15/66 (23%) and 4/66 (6%), respectively attained a robust response as defined by reaching the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD in convalescent serum from COVID-19 survivors. In patients receiving two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, seroconversion occurred in 69/72 (96%) for anti-spike and 63/72 (88%) for anti-RBD by 2 weeks following the second dose while 52/72 (72%) and 43/76 (41%) reached the median convalescent serum level of anti-spike and anti-RBD, respectively. In contrast, 35/35 (100%) of health care workers exceeded the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD found in convalescent serum 2-4 weeks after the second dose.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study confirms poor immunogenicity 28 days following a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in the hemodialysis population, supporting adherence to recommended vaccination schedules, and avoiding delay of the second dose in these at-risk individuals.

300,27926,COMPARATIVE IMMUNOGENICITY OF BNT162b2 mRNA VACCINE WITH NATURAL COVID-19 INFECTION,"The mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 has proven highly effective and currently many millions are being vaccinated. There are limited and conflicting data from immunogenicity studies on the effects of age, gender, vaccination side effects (VSE), risk factors for severe COVID-19 (RFS-COV), obesity (BMI) and previous SARS-CoV-2 (Pr-CoV) Moreover, immunogenicity data from COVID-19 patients comparing various disease categories of natural infection i.e. asymptomatic vs mild vs moderate vs severe infection are sparse, and include limited number of individuals.

This study included 871 vaccinated health care workers (HCW) and 181 patients with natural infection. Immunogenicity was assessed by a quantative assay measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 against the RBD domain of the spike protein (anti-RBD) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 against nucleocapsid protein (anti-N). Samples were collected 1-2 weeks after completion of the 2nd dose in the vaccinated HCWs and 15-59 days post symptoms onset in patients with natural infection.

The concentration of anti-RBD in vaccinated individuals after multivariable analysis was significantly associated with age, gender, VSE and Pr-CoV. Specifically, anti-RBD median levels (95% CI) were lower by 2,466 (651-5,583), 6,228 (3,254-9,203) and 7,651 (4,479-10,823) AU/ml in 35-44, 45-54, 55-70 yrs respectively, compared with 18-34 yrs group. In females, median levels of anti-RBD were higher by 2,823 (859-4,787) compared with males, in individuals with VSE were higher by 5,024 (3,122-6,926) compared with no VSE, and in HCWs with Pr-CoV were higher by 9,971 (5,158-14,783) AU/ml compared with HCWs without Pr-CoV.

Among individuals with natural infection, the median anti-RBD levels were 14.8 times higher in patients with critical COVID-19 infection compared with non-hospitalized individuals. The ratio of anti-RBD in vaccinated individuals versus those with natural infection varied from 1.0 up to 19.4 according to the clinical subgroup of natural infection.

We found no correlation between vaccine-associated symptom severity scores and vaccine-induced antibody titers one month after vaccination. We also observed that 1) post-vaccination symptoms were inversely correlated with age and weight and more common in women, 2) systemic symptoms were more frequent after the second vaccination, 3) high symptom scores after first vaccination were predictive of high symptom scores after second vaccination, and 4) older age was associated with lower titers.

LimitationsStudy only observes antibody responses and consists of healthy participants.

ConclusionsLack of post-vaccination symptoms following receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine does not equate to lack of vaccine-induced antibodies one month after vaccination. This study also suggests that it may be possible to design future mRNA vaccines that confer robust antibody responses with lower frequencies of vaccine-associated symptoms.

317,28292,"Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Immunocompromised Patients: An Observational, Prospective Cohort Study Interim Analysis","ObjectivesImmunocompromised patients were excluded from COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. The objectives of the study were to measure antibody responses, levels, and neutralization capability after COVID-19 vaccination among immunocompromised patients and compare these variables to those of immunocompetent healthcare workers.

MethodsThis is an interim analysis of an ongoing observational, prospective cohort study which launched on April 14, 2021 across Western Pennsylvania. Participants were healthy healthcare workers (HCW) and immunocompromised patients who had completed their COVID-19 vaccination series. Individuals with a history of COVID-19 were not eligible. Serum was collected to measure for the presence of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using a semi-quantitative assay; antibody levels were available for comparisons. A quasi-random subset of patients was selected for pseudovirus neutralization assays. Seropositivity with 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals and distribution of antibody levels were measured. To identify risk factors for seronegativity, clinical characteristics were univariately compared between antibody reactive and non-reactive individuals within the immunocompromised group.

Results107 HCW and 489 immunocompromised patients were enrolled. Compared to HCWs, seropositivity was significantly lower (p<.001) among immunocompromised patients with Solid organ transplant (SOT), autoimmune, hematological malignancies, and solid tumors (HCW=98.1%; SOT=37.2%; autoimmune=83.8%; hematological malignancies=54.7%; and solid tumor=82.4%, p < 0.05). Over 94% of patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus were seropositive. Among seropositive patients, antibody levels were much lower among SOT (4.5 [2.1,13.1], p=.020). Neutralization titers tightly correlated with antibody levels (Spearman r = 0.91, p < 0.0001).

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of the humoral immune response to COVID-19 vaccines based on underlying immunosuppressive condition and highlight an urgent need to optimize and individualize COVID-19 prevention in these patients. These findings also have implications on public health guidance, particularly given revised Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations permitting vaccinated individuals to abandon masking and social distancing in most settings. Future studies are warranted to determine assessment of cellular immunity, longitudinal measurement of immune responses, and the safety and efficacy of revaccination.",30/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.28.21259576,Ghady Haidar,University of Pittsburgh,medrxiv,Observational immunogenicity,0,,

166,21711,The effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162 b 2 vaccine in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization: real-world evidence,"BackgroundBNT162b2 vaccines showed high efficacy against COVID-19 in a randomised controlled phase-III trial. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in real life settings is urgently needed, especially given the global disease surge. Hence, we assessed the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the BNT162b2 Phase-III results, we hypothesized that the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinees will decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence during the preceding days.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2{middle dot}6 million-member state-mandated health provider in Israel. Study population consisted of all members aged 16 or above years who were vaccinated with BNT162b2-vaccine between December/19/2020 and January/15/2021. We collected information regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test from days after first dose to January/17/2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13-24 were compared to days 1-12 after first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models.

FindingsData of 503,875 individuals (mean age 59{middle dot}7 years SD=14{middle dot}7, 47{middle dot}8% males) were analysed, of whom 351,897 had 13-24 days of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0{middle dot}57% (n=2484) during days 1-12 and 0{middle dot}27% (n=614) in days 13-24. A 51{middle dot}4% relative risk reduction (RRR) was calculated in weighted-average daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 43{middle dot}41-per-100,000(SE=12{middle dot}07) in days 1-12 to 21{middle dot}08-per-100,000(SE=6{middle dot}16) in days 13-24 following immunization. The decrement in incidence was evident from day 18 after first dose. Similar RRRs were calculated in individuals aged 60 or above (44.5%), younger individuals (50.2%), females (50.0%) and males (52.1%). Findings were similar in sub-populations and patients with various comorbidities.

ConclusionsWe demonstrated an effectiveness of 51% of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization with the first dose. Immunization with the second dose should be continued to attain the anticipated protection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for follow-up studies regarding the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine without any language restrictions. The search terms were (BNT162b2 OR mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine) AND (effectiveness OR real-world OR phase IV) until Jan 15, 2021. We found no relevant observational studies among humans. We also assessed Phase II and Phase III clinical trials with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first and largest phase IV study on the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in real-world settings. Our findings showed that the first dose of the vaccine is associated with an approximately 51% reduction in the incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections at 13 to 24 days after immunization compared to the rate during the first 12 days. Similar levels of effectiveness were found across age groups, sex, as well as among individuals residing in Arab or ultra-orthodox Jewish communities that display an increased COVID-19 risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe study results indicate that in real life the first dose of the new BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine confers around 50% protection against overall SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Together our findings and the 95% efficacy shown in the phase III trial, suggest that the BNT162b2 vaccine should be administered in two doses to achieve maximum protection and impact in terms of disease burden reduction and possibly reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

However, vaccination trials included limited numbers of older people.

AimWe aimed to study infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 for older care home residents following vaccination and identify factors associated with increased risk of infection.

Study Design and SettingWe conducted an observational data-linkage study including 14,104 vaccinated older care home residents in Wales (UK) using anonymised electronic health records and administrative data.

MethodsWe used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination, after landmark times of either 7 or 21-days post-vaccination. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, sex, frailty, prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination type.

ResultsWe observed a small proportion of care home residents with positive PCR tests following vaccination 1.05% (N=148), with 90% of infections occurring within 28-days. For the 7-day landmark analysis we found a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals who had a previous infection; HR (95% confidence interval) 0.54 (0.30,0.95), and an increased HR for those receiving the Pfizer-BioNTECH vaccine compared to the Oxford-AstraZeneca; 3.83 (2.45,5.98). For the 21-day landmark analysis we observed high HRs for individuals with low and intermediate frailty compared to those without; 4.59 (1.23,17.12) and 4.85 (1.68,14.04) respectively.

ConclusionsIncreased risk of infection after 21-days was associated with frailty.

ObjectiveEstimate COVID-19 vaccinations impact on SARS-CoV-2 case rates and viral diversity among healthcare workers (HCW) during a high community prevalence period.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsA prospective cohort study from Boston Medical Center (BMC)s HCW vaccination program, where staff received two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.

MeasurementsPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases among HCWs from December 09, 2020 to February 23, 2021. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 rates per 100,000 person-day overall and by time from first injection (1-14 and >14 days) were compared with surrounding community rates. Viral genome sequences from SARS CoV-2 positive samples.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 cases occurred in 1.4% (96/7109) of HCWs given at least a first dose and 0.3% (17/5913) of HCWs given both vaccine doses. Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 infection rate ratios were 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00) 1-14 days and 0.18 (0.10-0.32) >14 days from first dose. HCW SARS-CoV-2 cases >14 days from initial dose compared to within 14 days were more often older (46 versus 38 years, p=0.007), Latinx (10% versus 8%, p=0.03), and asymptomatic (48% versus 11%, p=0.0002).

COVID-19 vaccine was allocated in a phased roll-out beginning December 14, 2020. Phase 1A included health care personnel with direct patient contact, and residents and staff of nursing homes (NHs) and assisted living facilities (ALFs). Following this initial phase, individuals 65 years of age and older became eligible for vaccination, along with individuals determined by hospital providers to be extremely medically vulnerable to COVID-19. This strategy was based on the desire to most immediately reduce morbidity and mortality, as COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is age-related. Through March 15, 2021, 4,338,099 individuals received COVID-19 vaccine, including 2,431,540 individuals who completed their vaccination series. Of all those vaccinated, 70% were 65 years of age and older, and 63% of those 65 years of age and older. Beginning February 1, 2021, the decline in the number of new cases per week became greater in those 65 years of age and older than those younger. By March 15, 2021, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per day for those 65 years of age and older relative to mid-January, were 82%, 80%, and 92% lower respectively. In comparison, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per day for those younger than 65 years of age were 70%, 60%, and 87% lower respectively. Reductions in rates in those 65 year of age and older, were thus greater than in those who were younger (p <0.01; Wilcoxon test).

255,25658,Real World Effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines against Hospitalizations and Deaths in the United States,"BackgroundCovid-19 has caused significant global mortality. Multiple vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials though real-world effectiveness of vaccines against Covid-19 mortality in clinically and demographically diverse populations has not yet been reported.

MethodsWe used a retrospective cohort assembled from a cross-institution comprehensive data repository. Established patients of the health care system were categorized as not immunized, partially immunized, or fully immunized against SARS-CoV-2 with an mRNA vaccine through April 4, 2021. Outcomes were Covid-19 related hospitalization and death.

ResultsOf the 91,134 established patients, 70.2% were not immunized, 4.5% were partially immunized and 25.4% were fully immunized. Among the fully immunized 0.7% had a Covid-19 hospitalization, whereas 3.4% among the partially immunized and 2.7% non-immunized individuals were hospitalized with Covid-19. Of the 225 deaths among Covid-19 hospitalizations, 219 (97.3%) were in the not immunized, 5 (2.2%) in the partially immunized, and 1 (0.0041%) in the fully immunized group. mRNA vaccines were 96% (95%CI: 95 -- 99) effective at preventing Covid-19 related hospitalization and 98.7% (95%CI: 91.0 -- 99.8) effective at preventing Covid-19 related death when participants were fully vaccinated. Partial vaccination was 77% (95%CI: 71 -- 82) effective at preventing hospitalization and 64.2% (95%CI: 13.0 -- 85.2) effective at preventing death. Vaccine effectiveness at preventing hospitalization was conserved across subgroups of age, race, ethnicity, Area Deprivation Index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index.

261,25996,Real-world effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S adenoviral vector vaccine for COVID-19,"In light of the massive and rapid vaccination campaign against COVID-19, continuous real-world effectiveness and safety assessment of the FDA-authorized vaccines is critical to amplify transparency, build public trust, and ultimately improve overall health outcomes. In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We compared the infection rate of 2,195 individuals who received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals between February 27th and April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%). Due to the recent authorization of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, there are not yet enough hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths within this cohort to robustly assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 severity, but these outcomes will be continually assessed in near-real-time with our platform. Collectively, this study provides further evidence that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reaffirms the urgent need to continue mass vaccination efforts globally.",30/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.27.21256193,Venky Soundararajan,nference,medrxiv,Effectiveness,0,,
263,26142,Population Vaccine Effectiveness and its Implication for Control of the Spread of COVID-19 in the US,"Realized vaccine efficacy in population is highly different from the individual vaccine efficacy measured in clinical trial. The realized vaccine efficacy in population is substantially affected by the vaccine age-stratified prioritization strategy, population age-structure, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We proposed a population vaccine efficacy which integrated individual vaccine efficacy, vaccine prioritization strategy and NPI to measure and monitor the control of the spread of COVID-19. We found that 11 states in the US had low population vaccine efficacy and 20 states had high population efficacy. We demonstrated that although the proportion of the population who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine across 11 low population vaccine efficacy states, in general, was greater than that in 20 high population vaccine efficacy states, the 11 low population vaccine efficacy states experienced the recent COVID-19 surge, while the number of new cases in the 20 high population vaccine efficacy states exponentially decreased. We demonstrated that the proportions of adults in the population across 50 states were significantly associated with the forecasted ending date of the COVID-19. We show that it was recent low proportion of adults vaccinated in Michigan that caused its COVID-19 surge. Using population vaccination efficacy, we forecasted that the earliest COVID-19 ending states were Hawaii, Arizona, Arkansas, and California (in the end of June, 2021) and the last COVID-19 ending states were Colorado, New York and Michigan (in the Spring, 2022).",05/05/2021,10.1101/2021.04.30.21256228,Momiao Xiong,University of Texas School of Public Health,medrxiv,Effectiveness,0,,
277,26839,Effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine in the elderly population during a P.1 variant-associated epidemic of COVID-19 in Brazil: A test-negative case-control study,"BackgroundMass vaccination is being used in response to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemics, including those driven by emerging variants of concern. We evaluated the effectiveness of the inactivated whole-virus vaccine, CoronaVac, against symptomatic COVID-19 in the elderly population of Sao Paulo State, Brazil during widespread circulation of the P.1 variant.

MethodsWe conducted a test-negative, case-control study of adults [&ge;]70 years of age from Sao Paulo State from January 17 to April 29, 2021, during which vaccination with a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac was implemented. We identified RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and controls who had a symptomatic illness with a negative RT-PCR test from national surveillance and state vaccination databases. Controls were pair-matched to cases by age category, sex, race, municipality, prior COVID-19 status, and date of RT-PCR testing. We estimated vaccine effectiveness, adjusted for age and comorbidities, using conditional logistic regression.

FindingsWe selected 7,950 matched pairs with a mean age of 76 years from 26,433 COVID-19 cases and 17,622 test-negative controls. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 18.2% (95% CI, 0.0 to 33.2) and 41.6% (95% CI, 26.9 to 53.3) in the period 0-13 and [&ge;]14 days, respectively, after the 2nd dose. Administration of a single vaccine dose was not associated with reduced odds of COVID-19. Vaccine effectiveness [&ge;]14 days after the 2nd dose declined with increasing age and was 61.8% (95% CI 34.8 to 77.7), 48.9% (95% CI 23.3 to 66.0) and 28.0% (95% CI 0.6 to 47.9) among individuals 70-74, 75-79 and [&ge;]80 years of age, respectively (pinteraction = 0.05).

InterpretationCoronaVac was 42% effective in the real-world setting of extensive P.1 transmission, but significant protection was not observed until completion of the two-dose regimen. These findings underscore the need to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions when mass vaccination with CoronaVac is used as part of an epidemic response.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Pubmed for articles published from inception of the pandemic until May 10, 2021, with no language restrictions, using the search terms ""vaccine"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""elderly"", ""age"", ""older"". There are no studies reporting the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against P.1, and few studies reporting real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines among elderly individuals.

Added value of this studyIn a population based matched test-negative case-control study conducted in a setting with widespread P.1 variant transmission, we observed that two-doses of CoronaVac was effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 among those aged 70 years or older, a population remarkably underrepresented in phase 3 clinical trials. There was no evidence for protection after the first dose. We observed a significant decline in effectiveness at older ages.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results showed that the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac likely needs the complete two-dose schedule for protection against symptomatic disease among the elderly. Additionally, effectiveness of the two-dose schedule decreased with age. These results have direct implications for national vaccination programs using CoronaVac, highlighting that non-pharmaceutical interventions should be in place throughout vaccination campaigns. Further research is needed on how to optimize the vaccination of the very elderly ([&ge;]80 years), considering different vaccine types or dosing schedules by age.",28/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.19.21257472,Julio Croda,"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA.

283,27054,"Post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection: risk factors and illness profile in a prospective, observational community-based case-control study","BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines show excellent efficacy in clinical trials and real-world data, but some people still contract SARS-CoV-2 despite vaccination. This study sought to identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination and describe characteristics of post-vaccination illness.

MethodsAmongst 1,102,192 vaccinated UK adults from the COVID Symptom Study, 2394 (0.2%) cases of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified between 8th December 2020 and 1st May 2021. Using a control group of vaccinated individuals testing negative, we assessed the associations of age, frailty, comorbidity, area-level deprivation and lifestyle factors with infection. Illness profile post-vaccination was assessed using a second control group of unvaccinated cases.

FindingsOlder adults with frailty (OR=2.78, 95% CI=[1.98-3.89], p-value<0.0001) and individuals living in most deprived areas (OR=1.22 vs. intermediate group, CI[1.04-1.43], p-value=0.01) had increased odds of post-vaccination infection. Risk was lower in individuals without obesity (OR=0.6, CI[0.44-0.82], p-value=0.001) and those reporting healthier diet (OR=0.73, CI[0.62-0.86], p-value<0.0001). Vaccination was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR=0.36, CI[0.28-0.46], p-value<0.0001), and high acute-symptom burden (OR=0.51, CI[0.42-0.61], p-value<0.0001). In older adults, risk of [&ge;]28 days illness was lower following vaccination (OR=0.72, CI[0.51-1.00], p-value=0.05). Symptoms were reported less in positive-vaccinated vs. positive-unvaccinated individuals, except sneezing, which was more common post-vaccination (OR=1.24, CI[1.05-1.46], p-value=0.01).

InterpretationOur findings suggest that older individuals with frailty and those living in most deprived areas are at increased risk of infection post-vaccination. We also showed reduced symptom burden and duration in those infected post-vaccination. Efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness in at-risk populations, and to targeted infection control measures, may still be appropriate to minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo identify existing evidence for risk factors and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination, we searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published between December 1, 2020 and May 18, 2021 using keywords (""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""Vaccine"" OR ""vaccination"") AND (""infection"") AND (""risk factor*"" OR ""characteristic*""). We did not restrict our search by language or type of publication. Of 202 articles identified, we found no original studies on individual risk and protective factors for COVID-19 infection following vaccination nor on nature and duration of symptoms in vaccinated, community-based individuals. Previous studies in unvaccinated populations have shown that social and occupational factors influence risk of SARS-CoV-2infection, and that personal factors (age, male sex, multiple morbidities and frailty) increased risk for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated good efficacy of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed in published real-world data, which additionally showed reduced risk of adverse outcomes including hospitalisation and death.

Added value of this studyThis is the first observational study investigating characteristics of and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after COVID-19 vaccination. We found that vaccinated individuals with frailty had higher rates of infection after vaccination than those without. Adverse determinants of health such as increased social deprivation, obesity, or a less healthy diet were associated with higher likelihood of infection after vaccination. In comparison with unvaccinated individuals, those with post-vaccination infection had fewer symptoms of COVID-19, and more were entirely asymptomatic. Fewer vaccinated individuals experienced five or more symptoms, required hospitalisation, and, in the older adult group, fewer had prolonged illness duration (symptoms lasting longer than 28 days).

Implications of all the available evidenceSome individuals still contract COVID-19 after vaccination and our data suggest that frail older adults and those living in more deprived areas are at higher risk. However, in most individuals illness appears less severe, with reduced need for hospitalisation and lower risk of prolonged illness duration. Our results are relevant for health policy post-vaccination and highlight the need to prioritise those most at risk, whilst also emphasising the balance between the importance of personal protective measures versus adverse effects from ongoing social restrictions. Strategies such as timely prioritisation of booster vaccination and optimised infection control could be considered for at-risk groups. Research is also needed on how to enhance the immune response to vaccination in those at higher risk.",27/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.24.21257738,Michela Antonelli,King\'s College London,medrxiv,Effectiveness,0,,
285,27154,The real-life impact of vaccination on COVID-19 mortality in Europe and Israel,"OBJECTIVESThis study aimed at estimating the real-life impact of vaccination on COVID-19 mortality, with adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 variants spread and other factors across Europe and Israel.

METHODSTime series analysis of daily number of COVID-19 deaths was performed using non-linear Poisson mixed regression models. Variants frequency, demographic, climate, health and mobility characteristics of thirty-two countries were considered as potentially relevant adjustment factors between January 2020 and April 2021.

RESULTSThe analysis revealed that vaccination efficacy in terms of protection against deaths was equal to 72%, with a lower reduction of number of deaths for B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7 variants (70% and 78%, respectively). Other factors significantly related to mortality were arrivals at airports, mobility change from the pre-pandemic level and temperature.

CONCLUSIONSOur study confirms a strong effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination based on real-life public data, although lower than expected from clinical trials. This suggests the absence of indirect protection for non-vaccinated individuals. Results also show that vaccination effectiveness against mortality associated with the B.1.1.7 variant is slightly lower compared with other variants. Lastly, this analysis confirms the role of mobility reduction, within and between countries, as an effective way to reduce COVID-19 mortality and suggests the possibility of seasonal variations in COVID-19 incidence.",29/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.26.21257844,Katarzyna Jablonska,Creativ-Ceutical,medrxiv,Effectiveness,0,,
286,27420,Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsEmployees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next five months, among previously infected subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated.

ResultsAmong the 52238 included employees, 1359 (53%) of 2579 previously infected subjects remained unvaccinated, compared with 20804 (42%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained almost zero among previously infected unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, compared with a steady increase in cumulative incidence among previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, after adjusting for the phase of the epidemic, vaccination was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among those not previously infected (HR 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 to 0.061) but not among those previously infected (HR 0.313, 95% CI 0 to Infinity).

ConclusionsIndividuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before.

SummaryCumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined among 52238 employees in an American healthcare system.

290,27439,Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines among Employees in an American Healthcare System,"BackgroundThe mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown great promise in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these vaccines under real-world conditions in the USA.

MethodsEmployees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System, previously not infected with SARS-CoV-2, and working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day COVID-19 vaccination began, were included. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, over the next 5 months, was compared among those who received the vaccine and those who did not, by modeling vaccination as a time-dependent covariate in Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusted for the slope of the epidemic curve as a continuous time-dependent covariate.

ResultsOf the 46866 included employees, 28223 (60%) were vaccinated by the end of the study period. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was much higher among those not vaccinated than those vaccinated. Only 15 (0.7%) of the 2154 SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study occurred among those vaccinated. After adjusting for the slope of the epidemic curve, age, and job type, vaccination was associated with a significantly reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 0.03, 95% C.I. 0.02 - 0.06, p < 0.001), corresponding to a vaccine effectiveness rate of 97.1% (95% CI 94.3 - 98.5). Vaccine effectiveness was 89.2% at 7 days and 95.0% at 14 days after the first vaccine dose.

ConclusionsThe mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are over 97% protective against COVID-19 in the working-age population, with substantial protection possibly apparent within a few days of the first dose.

SummaryThe effectiveness of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was evaluated among 46866 employees in an American healthcare system. After adjusting for age, job type, and the phase of the epidemic, vaccination was 97.1% effective in preventing COVID-19 among the fully vaccinated, and 89.2% protective within 7 days of the first dose.",05/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.02.21258231,Nabin K.

294,27563,"Single-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, including P.1 and B.1.1.7 variants: a test-negative design in adults 70 years and older in British Columbia, Canada","IntroductionRandomized-controlled trials of mRNA vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 included relatively few elderly participants. We assess singe-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) in adults [&ge;]70-years-old in British Columbia (BC), Canada where the second dose was deferred by up to 16 weeks and where a spring 2021 wave uniquely included co-dominant circulation of B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants of concern (VOC).

MethodsAnalyses included community-dwelling adults [&ge;]70-years-old with specimen collection between April 4 (epidemiological week 14) and May 1 (week 17). Adjusted VE was estimated by test-negative design through provincial laboratory and immunization data linkage. Cases were RT-PCR test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and controls were test-negative. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of a single-dose [&ge;]21 days before specimen collection, but a range of intervals was assessed. In variant-specific analyses, test-positive cases were restricted to those genetically-characterized as B.1.1.7, P.1 or non-VOC.

ResultsVE analyses included 16,993 specimens: 1,226 (7.2%) test-positive cases and 15,767 test-negative controls. Of 1,131 (92%) viruses genetically categorized, 509 (45%), 314 (28%) and 276 (24%) were B.1.1.7, P.1 and non-VOC lineages, respectively. VE was negligible at 14% (95% CI 0-26) during the period 0-13 days post-vaccination but increased from 43% (95% CI 30-53) at 14-20 days to 75% (95% CI 63-83) at 35-41 days post-vaccination. VE at [&ge;]21 days was 65% (95% CI 58-71) overall: 72% (95% CI 58-81), 67% (95% CI 57-75) and 61% (95% CI 45-72) for non-VOC, B.1.1.7 and P.1, respectively.

ConclusionsA single dose of mRNA vaccine reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in adults [&ge;]70-years-old by about two-thirds, with protection only minimally reduced against B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants. Substantial single-dose protection in older adults reinforces the option to defer the second dose when vaccine supply is scarce and broader first-dose coverage is needed.",09/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.07.21258332,Danuta M Skowronski,BC Centre for Disease Control,medrxiv,Effectiveness,0,,

We characterized CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses induced by AZD1222 vaccination in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 280 unique vaccine recipients aged 18-85 years who enrolled in the phase 2/3 COV002 trial. Total spike-specific CD4+ T cell helper type 1 (Th1) and CD8+ T-cell responses were significantly increased in AZD1222-vaccinated adults of all ages following two doses of AZD1222. CD4+ Th2 responses following AZD1222 vaccination were not detected. Furthermore, AZD1222-specific Th1 and CD8+ T cells both displayed a high degree of polyfunctionality in all adult age groups.

306,28071,Correlates of Protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundAlthough 6 COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organisation as of 16th June 2021, global supply remains limited. An understanding of the immune response associated with protection could facilitate rapid licensure of new vaccines.

MethodsData from a randomised efficacy trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in the UK was analysed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG by multiplex immunoassay, pseudovirus and live neutralising antibody at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and non-infected vaccine recipients. Weighted generalised additive models for binary data were applied to symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection data from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 recipients. Cubic spline smoothed log antibody levels, and weights were applied to account for potential selection bias in sample processing. Models were adjusted for baseline risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsHigher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. Vaccine efficacy of 80% against primary symptomatic COVID-19 was achieved with an antibody level of 40923 (95% CI: 16748, 125017) and 63383 (95% CI: 16903, not computed (NC)) for anti-spike and anti-RBD, and 185 (95% CI: NC, NC) and 247 (95% CI: 101, NC) for pseudo- and live-neutralisation assays respectively. Antibody responses did not correlate with overall protection against asymptomatic infection.

ConclusionsCorrelates of protection can be used to bridge to new populations using validated assays.

210,24099,Evidence for antibody as a protective correlate for COVID-19 vaccines,"Though eleven novel COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy, additional affordable, scalable, and deliverable vaccines are needed to meet unprecedented global demand. With placebo-controlled efficacy trials becoming infeasible due to the roll out of licensed vaccines, a correlate of protection is urgently needed to provide a path for regulatory approval of novel vaccines. To assess whether antibody titers may reasonably predict efficacy, we evaluated the relationship between efficacy and in vitro neutralizing and binding antibodies of 7 vaccines for which sufficient data have been generated. Once calibrated to titers of human convalescent sera reported in each study, a robust correlation was seen between neutralizing titer and efficacy ({rho}= 0.79) and binding antibody titer and efficacy ({rho} = 0.93), despite geographically diverse study populations subject to different forces of infection and circulating variants, and use of different endpoints, assays, convalescent sera panels and manufacturing platforms. This correlation is strengthened by substituting post-hoc analyses for efficacy against the ancestral strain (D614G), where available. Together with an accumulating body of evidence from natural history studies and animal models, these results support the use of post-immunization antibody titers as the basis for establishing a correlate of protection for COVID-19 vaccines.",20/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.17.20200246,Peter Dull,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,medrxiv,Correlate of protection,0,,
229,24808,Commercialized kit to assess T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 S peptides. A pilot study in Health Care Workers.,"BackgroundClinical trials on the different vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated protection efficacy, but it is urgent to assess the levels of protection generated with real-world data, especially in individuals professionally exposed. Measuring T-cell responses may complement antibody tests currently in use as correlates of protection but there are not validated T cell response applicable to large number of samples.

ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility of using T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 S peptides by commercially available whole blood interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) as a correlate of protection.

PatientsTwenty health care workers before and after vaccination.

MethodsAntibody test to SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins in parallel with one IGRA assay and two detection techniques than can be automated.

ResultsIGRA test detected T-cell responses in naturally exposed and vaccinated HCW already after first vaccination dose. the correlation by the two detection methods, CLIA and ELISA, very high (R>0.9) and sensitivity and specificity ranged between 100 and 86% and 100-73% respectively. Even though there was a very high concordance between antibody and the IGRA assay in the ability to detect immune response to SARS-CoV-2 there was a relatively low quantitative correlation. In the small group primed by natural infection, one vaccine dose was sufficient to reach immune response plateau. IGRA was positive in one Ig (S) antibody negative vaccinated immunosuppressed HCW illustrating another advantage of the IGRA test.

ConclusionWhole blood IGRA tests amenable to automation, as the one here reported, constitute a promising additional tool for measuring the state of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2; they are applicable to large number of samples and may become valuable correlates of protection to COVID-19, particularly for vulnerable groups at risk of being re-exposed to infection, as are health care workers.

Clinical ImplicationsCommercial kits of whole blood Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) constitute an reliable method for clinical laboratories to assess T-cell response after natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 and after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and are suitable for large scale application.

107,17988,Phase 1 Assessment of the Safety and Immunogenicity of an mRNA- Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Candidate Against SARS-CoV-2 in Human Volunteers,"There is an urgent need for vaccines to counter the COVID-19 pandemic due to infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Evidence from convalescent sera and preclinical studies has identified the viral Spike (S) protein as a key antigenic target for protective immune responses. We have applied an mRNA-based technology platform, RNActive(R), to develop CVnCoV which contains sequence optimized mRNA coding for a stabilized form of S protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Following demonstration of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in animal models we performed a dose-escalation phase 1 study in healthy 18-60 year-old volunteers.

This interim analysis shows that two doses of CVnCoV ranging from 2 g to 12 g per dose, administered 28 days apart were safe. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. There were dose-dependent increases in frequency and severity of solicited systemic adverse events, and to a lesser extent of local reactions, but the majority were mild or moderate and transient in duration. Immune responses when measured as IgG antibodies against S protein or its receptor-binding domain (RBD) by ELISA, and SARS-CoV-2-virus neutralizing antibodies measured by micro-neutralization, displayed dose-dependent increases. Median titers measured in these assays two weeks after the second 12 g dose were comparable to the median titers observed in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Seroconversion (defined as a 4-fold increase over baseline titer) of virus neutralizing antibodies two weeks after the second vaccination occurred in all participants who received 12 g doses.

Preliminary results in the subset of subjects who were enrolled with known SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at baseline show that CVnCoV is also safe and well tolerated in this population, and is able to boost the pre-existing immune response even at low dose levels.

Based on these results, the 12 g dose is selected for further clinical investigation, including a phase 2b/3 study that will investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine CVnCoV.",09/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.09.20228551,Lidia Oostvogels,CureVac,medrxiv,1,0,,

MethodsThe phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late phase studies in younger (18-59 years) and older (60-84 years) participants and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through day 35 (14 days after the second dose). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one or two intramuscular doses of 5-{micro}g or 25-{micro}g NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7-day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild-type virus neutralizing antibody response.

ResultsAfter randomization, approximately 250 participants each were assigned to one of four vaccine groups or placebo. Of these, approximately 45% were older participants. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose, and occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. The two-dose regimen of 5-{micro}g NVX-CoV2373 induced robust geometric mean titer (GMT) IgG anti-spike protein (65,019 and 28,137 EU/mL) and wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (2201 and 981 titers) responses in younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups. Neutralizing antibody responses exceeded those seen in convalescent sera for both age groups.

ConclusionsThe study confirmed that the two-dose regimen of 5-{micro}g NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and well tolerated in both younger and older participants.

230,24729,Interim Report: Safety And Immunogenicity Of An Inactivated Vaccine Against Sars-Cov-2 In Healthy Chilean Adults In A Phase 3 Clinical Trial,"BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, with an incommensurable social and economic burden. The rapid development of safe and protective vaccines against this disease is a global priority. CoronaVac is a vaccine prototype based on inactivated SARS-CoV-2, which has shown promising safety and immunogenicity profiles in pre-clinical studies and phase 1/2 trials in China. To this day, four phase 3 clinical trials are ongoing with CoronaVac in Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Chile. This article reports the safety and immunogenicity results obtained in a subgroup of participants aged 18 years and older enrolled in the phase 3 Clinical Trial held in Chile.

MethodsThis is a multicenter phase 3 clinical trial. Healthcare workers aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned to receive two doses of CoronaVac or placebo separated by two weeks (0-14). We report preliminary safety results obtained for a subset of 434 participants, and antibody and cell-mediated immunity results obtained in a subset of participants assigned to the immunogenicity arm. The primary and secondary aims of the study include the evaluation of safety parameters and immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 after immunization, respectively. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04651790).

FindingsThe recruitment of participants occurred between November 27th, 2020, until January 9th, 2021. 434 participants were enrolled, 397 were 18-59 years old, and 37 were [&ge;]60 years old. Of these, 270 were immunized with CoronaVac, and the remaining 164 participants were inoculated with the corresponding placebo. The primary adverse reaction was pain at the injection site, with a higher incidence in the vaccine arm (55.6%) than in the placebo arm (40.0%). Moreover, the incidence of pain at the injection site in the 18-59 years old group was 58.4% as compared to 32.0% in the [&ge;]60 years old group. The seroconversion rate for specific anti-S1-RBD IgG was 47.8% for the 18-59 years old group 14 days post immunization (p.i.) and 95.6% 28 and 42 days p.i. For the [&ge;]60 years old group, the seroconversion rate was 18.1%, 100%, and 87.5% at 14, 28, and 42 days p.i., respectively. Importantly, we observed a 95.7% seroconversion rate in neutralizing antibodies for the 18-59 years old group 28 and 42 days p.i. The [&ge;]60 years old group exhibited seroconversion rates of 90.0% and 100% at 28 and 42 days p.i. Interestingly, we did not observe a significant seroconversion rate of anti-N-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for the 18-59 years old group. For the participants [&ge;]60 years old, a modest rate of seroconversion at 42 days p.i. was observed (37.5%). We observed a significant induction of a T cell response characterized by the secretion of IFN-{gamma} upon stimulation with Mega Pools of peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. No significant differences between the two age groups were observed for cell-mediated immunity.

InterpretationImmunization with CoronaVac in a 0-14 schedule in adults of 18 years and older in the Chilean population is safe and induces specific IgG production against the S1-RBD with neutralizing capacity, as well as the activation of T cells secreting IFN-{gamma}, upon recognition of SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

235,24969,Prime hAd5 Spike plus Nucleocapsid Vaccination Induces Ten-Fold Increases in Mean T-Cell Responses in Phase 1 Subjects that are Sustained Against Spike Variants,"In response to the need for a safe, efficacious vaccine that provides broad immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have developed a dual-antigen COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine delivers both the viral spike (S) protein modified to increase cell-surface expression (S-Fusion) and the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) to enhance MHC class I and II presentation and T-cell responses. The vaccine antigens are delivered using a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) platform with E1, E2b, and E3 regions deleted that has been shown in previous cancer vaccine studies to be effective in the presence of pre-existing hAd5 immunity. Here, we demonstrate the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD (hAd5 S + N) vaccine antigens when expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) of previously SARS-CoV-2-infected patients elicit Th1 dominant activation of autologous patient T cells, indicating the vaccine antigens have the potential for generating immune responses in patients previously infected or vaccinated. We further demonstrate that participants in our open-label Phase 1b study of the dual-antigen hAd5 S + N vaccine generate Th1 dominant S- and N-specific T cells after a single prime subcutaneous injection and that the magnitude of these responses were comparable to those seen for T cells from previously infected patients. We further present our in silico prediction of T-cell epitope HLA binding for both the first-wave SARS-CoV-2  A strain and the K417N, E484K, and N501Y S as well as the T201I N variants that suggests T-cell responses to the hAd5 S + N vaccine will retain efficacy against these variants. These findings that the dual-antigen hAd5 S + N vaccine elicits SARS-CoV-2-relevant T-cell responses and that such cell-mediated protection is likely to be sustained against emerging variants supports the testing of this vaccine as a universal booster that would enhance and broaden existing immune protection conferred by currently approved S-based vaccines.",09/06/2021,10.1101/2021.04.05.21254940,Patrick Soon-Shiong,"ImmunityBio, Inc.",medrxiv,1,0,,

Although impressive progress has been made with several COVID-19 vaccines already approved, it is clear that those developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We have developed a COVID-19 vaccine based on a replication-defective gorilla adenovirus expressing the stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, named GRAd-COV2. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a single-dose regimen of this vaccine in healthy younger and older adults to select the appropriate dose for each age group. To this purpose, a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial was conducted including 90 healthy subjects, (45 aged 18-55 years and 45 aged 65-85 years), who received a single intramuscular administration of GRAd-CoV2 at three escalating doses. Local and systemic adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate and of short duration, and no serious AE was reported. Four weeks after vaccination, seroconversion to Spike/RBD was achieved in 43/44 young volunteers and in 45/45 older subjects. Consistently, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 42/44 younger age and 45/45 older age volunteers. In addition, GRAd-COV2 induced a robust and Th1-skewed T cell response against the S antigen in 89/90 subjects from both age groups. Overall, the safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 trial support further development of this vaccine.

267,26195,Preliminary Analysis of Safety and Immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 Variant Vaccine Booster,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has led to more than 3 million deaths worldwide. Safe and effective vaccines are now available, including the mRNA-1273 prototype vaccine, which encodes for the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein stabilized in the prefusion conformation by 2 proline substitutions. This vaccine showed 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical study. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, some of which have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibody, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. In addition, recent evidence of waning antibody levels after infection or vaccination point to the need for periodic boosting of immunity. Here we present the preliminary evaluation of a clinical study on the use of the prototype mRNA-1273 or modified COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as booster vaccines in participants previously vaccinated approximately 6 months earlier with two doses of the prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273. The modified vaccines include a monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encoding for the S protein found in the B.1.351 variant and multivalent mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. As single 50 {micro}g booster vaccinations, both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 had acceptable safety profiles and were immunogenic. Antibody neutralization titers against B.1.351 and P.1 variants measured by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays before the booster vaccinations, approximately 6 to 8 months after the primary series, were low or below the assay limit of quantification, although geometric mean titers versus the wild-type strain remained above levels likely to be protective. Two weeks after the booster vaccinations, titers against the wild-type original strain, B.1.351, and P.1 variants increased to levels similar to or higher than peak titers after the primary series vaccinations. Although both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 boosted neutralization of the wild-type original strain, and B.1.351 and P.1 variants, mRNA-1273.351 appeared to be more effective at increasing neutralization of the B.1.351 virus versus a boost with mRNA-1273. The vaccine trial is ongoing and boosting of clinical trial participants with the multivalent mRNA-1273.211 is currently being evaluated.",06/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.05.21256716,Roderick Mcphee,"Moderna, Inc.",medrxiv,1,0,,
269,26255,"Safety and immunogenicity of INO-4800 DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in adults at high risk of viral exposure","BackgroundVaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are still urgently needed as only 5% of the global population has been vaccinated. Here we report the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine (INO-4800) targeting the full-length Spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 when given to adults at high-risk of exposure.

MethodsINO-4800 was evaluated in 401 participants randomized at a 3:3:1:1 ratio to receive either INO-4800 (1 mg or 2 mg dose) or placebo (1 or 2 injections) intradermally (ID) followed by electroporation (EP) using CELLECTRA(R) 2000 at Days 0 and 28. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04642638

FindingsThe majority of adverse events (AEs) were of Grade 1 and 2 in severity and did not appear to increase in frequency with the second dose. The number of participants experiencing each of the most common AEs did not differ appreciably between the two dosing groups. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of binding and neutralizing antibody levels were statistically significantly greater in the 2.0 mg dose group versus the 1.0 mg dose group. The T cell immune responses measured by the ELISpot assay were also higher in the 2.0 mg dose group compared to the 1.0 mg dose group.

InterpretationINO-4800 at both the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses when administered in a 2-dose regimen appeared to be safe and well-tolerated in all adult ages. However, the comparative immunogenicity analysis favored selection of INO-4800 2.0 mg dose for advancement into a Phase 3 efficacy evaluation.

FundingThe trial was funded by the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, (JPEO-CBRND) in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD(HA)) and the Defense Health Agency.

272,26574,Efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 Covid-19 Vaccine Against the B.1.1.7 Variant,"BackgroundCovid-19 vaccines are urgently needed, especially against emerging variants. NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 rS) nanoparticle vaccine containing trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant.

MethodsA phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults 18-84 years old who received two intramuscular 5-{micro}g doses, 21 days apart, of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo (1:1) across 33 sites in the United Kingdom. The primary efficacy endpoint was virologically confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 with onset 7 days after second vaccination in serologically negative participants.

ResultsA total of 15,187 participants were randomized, of whom 7569 received NVX-CoV2373 and 7570 received placebo; 27.2% were 65 years or older, 44.7% had comorbidities and 4.2% had baseline serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2. There were 10 cases of Covid-19 among NVX-CoV2373 recipients and 96 cases among placebo recipients, with symptom onset at least 7 days after second vaccination; NVX-CoV2373 was 89.7% (95% confidence interval, 80.2 to 94.6) effective in preventing Covid-19, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported. There were five cases of severe Covid-19, all in the placebo group. Post hoc analysis revealed efficacies of 96.4% (73.8 to 99.5) and 86.3% (71.3 to 93.5) against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant, respectively. Vaccine efficacy was similar across subgroups, including participants with comorbidities and those [&ge;]65 years old. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups.

ConclusionA two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 conferred 89.7% protection against a blend of prototype and variant Covid-19, demonstrated high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant, and had a reassuring safety profile.

274,26606,Interim Report of a Phase 2 Randomized Trial of a Plant-Produced Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 in Healthy Adults Aged 18-64 and Older Adults Aged 65 and Older,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally continues to impact humanity on a global scale with rising morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of multiple effective vaccines, new vaccines continue to be required to supply ongoing demand. We report Day 42 interim safety and immunogenicity data from a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Adults aged 18+ immunized with a virus-like particle vaccine candidate produced in plants displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (CoVLP) adjuvanted with AS03 (NCT04636697). This report focuses on presenting safety, tolerability and immunogenicity, as measured by neutralizing antibody (NAb) and cell mediated immunity (IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 ELISpot) responses, in Adults aged 18-64 (Adults) and Older Adults aged 65+ (Older Adults). CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 was well-tolerated and adverse events (AE) were primarily mild or moderate and of transient duration. AEs in Older Adults were more limited than those observed in the Adult population. CoVLP with AS03 induced a significant humoral immune response in both age cohorts. CoVLP with AS03 induced a greater humoral response in Adults than Older Adults after a single dose but this effect was overcome with a second dose when both age cohorts responded with NAb titers that were [~]10-fold higher than those in a panel of sera from patients recovering from COVID-19. A single dose of CoVLP with AS03 induced a significant IFN-{gamma} response in both age cohorts; a second dose significantly boosted IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses in both age cohorts. Adults generated a stronger IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 cellular response than did Older Adults after one or two doses of AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP. Safety and immunogenicity from Adults with comorbidities as well as final safety and immunogenicity responses after 12 months will be reported upon availability.",17/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.14.21257248,Nathalie Landry,"Medicago Inc., 1020 route de lÉglise office 600, Quebec, QC, Canada, G1V 3V9",medrxiv,1,0,,
284,27240,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant DNA COVID-19 vaccine containing the coding regions of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins: Preliminary results from an open-label, phase 1 trial in healthy adults aged 19-55 years","BackgroundWe investigated the safety and immunogenicity of two recombinant COVID-19 DNA vaccine candidates in first-in-human trials. GX-19 contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and GX-19N contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) foldon and nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

MethodsTwo open-label phase 1 trials of GX-19 and GX-19N safety and immunogenicity were performed in healthy adults aged 19-55 years. GX-19 trial participants received two vaccine injections (1{middle dot}5 mg or 3{middle dot}0 mg, 1:1 ratio) four weeks apart. GX-19N trial participants received two 3{middle dot}0 mg vaccine injections four weeks apart.

FindingsBetween June 17 and July 30 and December 28 and 31, 2020, 40 and 21 participants were enrolled in the GX-19 and GX-19N trials, respectively. Thirty-two participants (52{middle dot}5%) reported 80 treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) after vaccination. All solicited AEs were mild except one case of moderate fatigue reported in the 1{middle dot}5 mg GX-19 group. Binding antibody responses increased after vaccination in all groups. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of spike-binding antibodies on day 57 were 85{middle dot}74, 144{middle dot}20, and 201{middle dot}59 in the 1{middle dot}5 mg, 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19 groups and the 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19N group, respectively. In GX-19N group, neutralizing antibody response (50% neutralizing titer using FRNT) significantly increased after vaccination, but GMT of neutralizing antibody on day 57 (37.26) was lower than those from human convalescent serum (288.78). GX-19N induced stronger T cell responses than GX-19. The magnitude of GX-19N-induced T cell responses was comparable to those observed in the convalescent PBMCs. GX-19N induced both SARS-CoV-2 spike- and NP-specific T cell responses, and the amino acid sequences of 15-mer peptides containing NP-specific T cell epitopes identified in GX-19N-vaccinated participants were identical with those of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants

InterpretationGX-19N is safe, tolerated and induces humoral and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response which may enable cross-reactivity to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo overcome the COVID-19 outbreak, the development of safe and effective vaccines is crucial. Despite the successful clinical efficacy of the approved vaccines, concerns exist regarding emerging new SARS-CoV-2 variants that have mutated receptor binding domains in the spike protein. We searched PubMed for research articles published up to May 1, 2021, using various combinations of the terms ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""vaccine"", and ""clinical trial"". No language or data restrictions were applied. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and World Health Organization (WHO) draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines for ongoing trials of COVID-19 vaccines up to May 1, 2021. Ten DNA-based vaccines, including the vaccine candidate reported here, are in ongoing clinical trials. Among these, safety and immunogenicity results were reported from only one phase 1 trial of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (INO-4800). INO-4800 demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability and was immunogenic, eliciting humoral and/or cellular immune responses in all vaccinated subjects. There is only one ongoing clinical trial of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants (mRNA-1273.351).

Added value of this studyThis is the first-in-human phase 1 trial in healthy adults of a recombinant DNA vaccine for COVID-19 (GX-19N) containing the coding regions of both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins. This trial showed that GX-19N is safe, tolerated, and able to induce both humoral and cellular responses. A two-dose vaccination of 3{middle dot}0 mg GX-19N (on days 1 and 29) induced significant humoral and cellular responses. The neutralizing geometric mean titers in individuals vaccinated with GX-19N were lower than those of human convalescent sera. However, the GX-19N group showed increased T cell responses, which was similar to those analyzed using convalescent PBMCs. Furthermore, GX-19N induced not only SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell responses but also broad nucleocapsid-specific T cell responses, which were also specific to SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Implications of all the available evidenceIt is important to note that GX-19N contains a plasmid encoding both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, and that it showed broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, which may allow cross-reactivity with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on these safety and immunogenicity findings, GX-19N was selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials.",01/06/2021,10.1101/2021.05.26.21257700,Jun Yong Choi,"Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, South Korea",medrxiv,1,0,,

MethodsWe did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Healthy adults (age 18-98 years) randomised 1:1 using a computer-generated randomisation scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary outcomes were efficacy in sub-groups for age (18-< 60 years and [&ge;] 60 years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses for three consecutive manufacturing lots.

FindingsBetween November 16, 2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198). In a case-driven analysis, 130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in 16,973 (0{middle dot}77%) participants with follow-up at least two weeks after the second vaccination; 24 occurred in the vaccine group and 106 in placebo recipients giving an overall vaccine efficacy of 77{middle dot}8% (95% CI: 65{middle dot}2-86{middle dot}4). Sixteen cases, one vaccinee and 15 placebo recipients, met the severe symptomatic COVID-19 case definition giving a vaccine efficacy of 93{middle dot}4% (57{middle dot}1-99{middle dot}8). Efficacy against asymptomatic COVID-19 was 63{middle dot}6% (29{middle dot}0-82{middle dot}4).

BBV152 was well tolerated with no clinically or statistically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between vaccine and placebo groups. No cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths were reported.

InterpretationBBV152 was immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events observed over a median of 146 days that was lower than that observed with other COVID-19 vaccines.

MethodsPhase 1 of this trial (N=42) assessed the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of ascending levels of one-dose ARCT-021, a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine against Covid-19. Phase 2 (N=64) tested two-doses of ARCT-021 given 28 days apart. Both young and older adults were enrolled. The primary safety outcomes were local and systemic solicited adverse events (AEs) reported immediately and up to 7 days post-inoculation and unsolicited events reported up to 56 days after inoculation. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were antibody and T cell responses to vaccination, respectively.

ResultsARCT-021 was well tolerated up to one 7.5 g dose and two 5.0 g doses. Local solicited AEs, namely injection-site pain and tenderness, as well as systemic solicited AEs, such as fatigue, headache and myalgia, were more common in ARCT-021 than placebo recipients, and in younger than older adults. Seroconversion rate for anti-S IgG was 100% in all cohorts except for the 1 g one-dose in younger adults and the 7.5 g one-dose in older adults, which were each 80%. Neutralizing antibody titers increased with increasing dose although the responses following 5.0 g and 7.5 g ARCT-021 were similar. Anti-S IgG titers overlapped with those in Covid-19 convalescent plasma. ARCT-021 also elicited T-cell responses against the S glycoprotein.

MethodsWe conducted a dose-escalation, open label trial (phase 1) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase 2) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Nanocovax vaccine (in 25 microgram (mcg), 50 mcg, and 75 mcg doses, aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted). In phase 1, 60 participants received two intramuscular injection of the vaccine following dose-escalation procedure. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and laboratory tests to evaluate the vaccine safety. In phase 2 which involved in 560 healthy adults, the primary outcomes are vaccine safety; and anti-S IgG antibody response. Secondary outcomes were surrogate virus neutralization, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and T-cell responses by intracellular staining (ICS) for interferon gamma (IFNg). We performed primary analyses at day 35 and day 42.

ResultsFor phase 1 study, no serious adverse events (SAE) were observed for all 60 participants. Most adverse events (AE) were grade 1 and disappeared shortly after injection. For phase 2 study, after randomization, 480 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant, and 80 participants were assigned to receive placebo. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants and of short duration (mean, [&le;]3 days). Unsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to Nanocovax. Regarding the immunogenicity, Nanocovax induced robust anti-S antibody responses. There was no statistical difference in antibody responses among dose strengths on Day 42, in terms of anti S-IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer.

343,29555,"Immunogenicity and safety of a third dose, and immune persistence of CoronaVac vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-59 years: interim results from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial","BackgroundLarge-scale vaccination is being implemented globally with CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immunogenicity and safety profiles of homologous two-dose schedules have been published. We report interim results of immune persistence, and the immunogenicity and safety of a third dose of CoronaVac.

MethodsIn this ongoing, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2 trial in 18-to-59-year-olds, we randomly assigned subjects, 1:1:1:1, to one of four schedules to receive a third dose, 28 days or 6 months after two two-dose regimens (14-day or 28-day apart): schedule 1: days 0, 14, 42; schedule 2: days 0, 14, 194; schedule 3: days 0, 28, 56; schedule 4: days 0, 28, 208. For each schedule, participants were randomly assigned to either a medium-dose group (3 g per 0.5 mL of aluminum hydroxide diluent per dose), a high-dose group (6 g), or a placebo group (2:2:1). The primary outcome was geometric mean titers (GMTs) of neutralizing antibody to live SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsOverall, 540 participants received a third dose. In the 3 g group, neutralizing antibody titers induced by the first two doses declined after 6-8 months to below the seropositive cutoff (GMT: 4.1 [95%CI 3.3-5.2] for Schedule 2 and 6.7 [95%CI 5.2-8.6] for Schedule 4). When a third dose was given 6-8 months after a second dose, GMTs assessed 14 days later increased to 137.9 [95%CI 99.9-190.4] for Schedule 2, and 143.1 [95%CI 110.8-184.7] for Schedule 4, approximately 3-fold above Schedule 1 and Schedule 3 GMTs after third doses. Similar patterns were observed for the 6 g group. The severity of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported within 28 days after the third dose were grade 1 to grade 2 in all vaccination cohorts. None of the fourteen serious adverse events were considered to be related to vaccination.

ConclusionsA third dose of CoronaVac administered 6 or more months after a second dose effectively recalled specific immune response to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a remarkable increase in antibody levels, and indicating that a two-dose schedule generates good immune memory. Optimizing the timing of a booster dose should take into account immunogenicity, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, local epidemic situation, infection risk, and vaccine supply.

345,29593,"Tolerability, safety and immunogenicity of intradermal delivery of a fractional dose mRNA -1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in healthy adults as a dose sparing strategy","BackgroundThere is an urgent need for fair and equitable access to safe and effective vaccines to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortages in reagents and vaccines are a major challenge, as well as limited knowledge on dose response relationship with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We explored intradermal fractional dose administration of a mRNA SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine as a potential dose-sparing strategy.

MethodsWe conducted a proof-of-concept, dose-escalation, open-label, randomised-controlled vaccine trial (IDSCOVA) in healthy adults aged 18-30 years. To test initial safety, ten participants received 10 {micro}g mRNA-1273 vaccine through intradermal injection at day 1 and 29. Following a favourable safety review, thirty participants were 1:1 randomised to receive 20 {micro}g mRNA-1273 either intradermally or intramuscularly. The primary endpoint was tolerability and safety. The secondary endpoint was seroconversion and specific IgG concentration against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) after the second dose at day 43. We compared results to two historical cohorts of non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals.

FindingsThirty-eight of forty included participants (median age 25 years) completed the study. There were no serious adverse events. Self-reported local adverse reactions after intradermal delivery were mild, both in the 10 {micro}g and the 20 {micro}g group. In the higher dose group, systemic adverse reactions were more common, but still well tolerated. All 38 participants mounted substantially higher IgG-anti-S1 and IgG-anti-RBD concentrations at day 43 than COVID-19 controls. At day 43, anti-S1 (95% CI) was 1,696 (1,309-2,198) BAU/mL for the 10 {micro}g intradermal group, 1,406 (953{middle dot}5-2,074) BAU/mL for the 20 {micro}g intramuscular group and 2,057 (1,421-2,975) BAU/mL for the 20 {micro}g intradermal group. Anti-S1 was 107{middle dot}2 (63-182{middle dot}2) BAU/mL for the convalescent plasma control group and 1,558 (547{middle dot}8-4,433) BAU/mL for the individuals vaccinated with 100 {micro}g mRNA-1273.

InterpretationIntradermal administration of 10 {micro}g and 20 {micro}g mRNA-1273 vaccine was well tolerated and safe, and resulted in a robust antibody response. Intradermal vaccination has the potential to be deployed for vaccine dose-sparing.

BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against COVID-19 and is currently authorized for emergency use or conditional approval worldwide. At the time of authorization, data beyond 2 months post-vaccination were unavailable.

MethodsIn an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy study, 44,165 [&ge;]16-year-old participants and 2,264 12-15-year-old participants were randomized to receive 2 doses, 21 days apart, of 30 {micro}g BNT162b2 or placebo. Study endpoints reported here are vaccine efficacy (VE) against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and safety data, both up to 6 months post-vaccination.

ResultsBNT162b2 continued to be safe and well tolerated. Few participants had adverse events leading to study withdrawal. VE against COVID-19 was 91% (95% CI 89.0-93.2) through up to 6 months of follow-up, among evaluable participants and irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE of 86%-100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse characteristics of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and COVID-19 risk factors in participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE against severe disease was 97% (95% CI 80.3-99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, B.1.351 (beta), was predominant, 100% (95% CI 53.5, 100.0) VE was observed.

331,29194,Association between willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and sources of health information among Japanese workers: a cohort study,"BackgroundIt is important to achieve herd immunity by vaccinating as many people as possible to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the relationship between willingness to receive vaccination and sources of health information among those who did not want to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

MethodsThis prospective cohort study collected data using a self-administered questionnaire survey. The baseline survey was conducted during December 22-25, 2020, and the follow-up survey during February 18-19, 2021. Participants were aged 20-65 years and worked at the time of the baseline survey (N = 33,087). After excluding 6,051 invalid responses, we included responses from 27,036 participants at baseline. In total, 19,941 people responded to the follow-up survey (74% follow-up rate). We excluded 7,415 participants who answered ""yes"" to the question ""If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, would you like to get it?"" in the baseline survey. We finally analyzed 12,526 participants.

ResultsThe odds ratio for change in willingness to be vaccinated from ""no"" to ""yes"" differed by source of health information. Compared with workers that used TV as a source of information, significantly fewer people who reported getting information from the Internet and friends/colleagues were willing to get the vaccine.

ConclusionsIt is important to approach workers who do not watch TV when implementing workplace vaccination programs. It is likely that willingness to be vaccinated can be increased through an active company policy whereby the top management recommend vaccination, coupled with an individual approach by occupational health professionals.

In this study, IS was applied to calibrate neutralizing antibody titers (IU/mL) and binding antibody titers (BAU/mL) in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Serum samples were collected from participants receiving the Moderna (n = 20) and Pfizer (n = 20) vaccines at three time points: pre-vaccination, after one dose, and after two doses. We obtained geometric mean titers of 1404.16 and 928.75 IU/mL for neutralizing antibodies after two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, respectively. These values provide an important baseline for vaccine development and the implementation of non-inferiority trials.

334,29346,Validation and performance evaluation of a novel interferon-γ release assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response,"BackgroundThe reliable detection of the T-cell mediated response to COVID-19 or COVID-19 vaccination is important for individual patient care and for monitoring the immune response e.g. in COVID-19 vaccine trials in a standardized fashion.

MethodsWe used blood samples from health care workers (HCW) with or without history of COVID-19 to define test accuracy of a novel interferon-release assay. Usefulness of qualitative and quantitative results after COVID-19 vaccination was examined in HCW receiving homologous or heterologous vaccination regimens. For a real-life performance evaluation, we analysed interferon-response to complete vaccination in 149 patients receiving immunosuppressive or immune modulating therapies.

ResultsUsing a double-cut-off strategy integrating the result of background stimulation the assay had a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity of the IGRA was 83.5 and 100% in HCW after SARS-CoV-2 infection more or less than 6 months ago. Quantitative results showed significant differences between first and second vaccine dose, but no difference between homologous and heterologous vaccination regimen. The majority of immunocompromised patients showed no immune response or isolated T-cell or antibody response to complete vaccination.

ConclusionsThe novel IGRA proved to be a highly specific and sensitive tool to detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response to COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 vaccination.

336,29269,Public Opinion and Sentiment Before and at the Beginning of COVID-19 Vaccinations in Japan: Twitter Analysis,"BackgroundThe global public health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have been substantial. To achieve herd immunity, widespread use of the vaccine is required, and it is therefore critical for government and public health agencies to understand public perceptions of the vaccine to help sustain subsequent vaccinations.

ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the opinions and sentiments of tweets about COVID-19 vaccination among Twitter users in Japan, both before and at the beginning of the COVID-19 vaccination program.

MethodsWe collected 144,101 Japanese tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords from Japanese Twitter users between August 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Specifically, we identified temporal changes in the number of tweets and key events that triggered a surge in the number of tweets. In addition, we performed sentiment analysis, and calculated the correlation between different sentiments and the number of deaths, infections, and vaccinations. We also built latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also provided a word cloud of high-frequency unigram and bigram tokens as additional evidence, and conducted further analysis on three different vaccine brands.

ResultsThe overall number of tweets has continued to increase since the start of mass vaccination in Japan. Sentiments were generally neutral, but negative sentiment was more significant than positive sentiment. Before and after the first vaccination in Japan, the correlations of negative/positive sentiment with death, infection, and vaccination cases changed significantly. Public concerns revolved around three themes: information on vaccine reservations and vaccinations in Japan; infection and mutation of COVID-19 in Japan; and prevention measures, vaccine development and supply, and vaccination status in other countries. Furthermore, public attention to the three brands of vaccines has a temporal shift as clinical trials move forward.

ConclusionsThe number of tweets and changes in sentiment might be driven by major news events in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine, with negative sentiments dominating positive sentiments overall. Death and infection cases correlated significantly with negative sentiments, but the correlation fell after vaccinations began as morbidity and mortality decreased. The publics attention to different vaccine brands had a temporal change during their clinical trial process, and although the discussion points are slightly different, the core remains effective and secure.",22/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.19.21260735,Momoko Nagai-Tanima,Kyoto University,medrxiv,0,0,,
337,29369,The efficacy of vaccines in the context of COVID-19 and its variants: Role of Spatio-temporal boundary,"The vaccine efficacy is a crucial determining factor in choosing a vaccine candidate for human use. When the choices of vaccines are many, the decision-making becomes difficult. General public resorts to the media and news, which talks about efficacies of various vaccines as observed for COVID-19. In this paper, for the first time, a concise mathematical framework for analyzing the efficacy of vaccines is introduced based on the standard definition of vaccine efficacy. The framework is then generalized to incorporate multi-variants. Finally, we introduce the idea of combined efficacy to characterize a vaccine efficacy as obtained from various clinical trials carried out across the world for Covid-19. We show that the efficacy reported by vaccine manufacturers from clinical trial data need not always directly translate to percentage efficacy. The efficacy of a vaccine is inherently a spatio-temporal statistical measure that characterizes a vaccine, which depends on the geographical location, the sample size, and the time of the clinical trials. Here, the dependence of efficacy on spatio-temporal parameters is expounded in detail, using hypothetical clinical trials conducted for different regions at different time intervals using real-world data.",22/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.19.21260758,Saptarshi Basu,Indian Institute of Science,medrxiv,0,0,,
339,29374,Typically asymptomatic but with robust antibody formation: Childrens unique humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2,"Background: Long-term persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, particularly the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimer, determines individual protection against infection and potentially viral spread. The quality of children's natural humoral immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet incompletely understood but crucial to guide pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs. Methods: In this prospective observational multi-center cohort study, we followed 328 households, consisting of 548 children and 717 adults, with at least one member with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serological response was assessed at 3-4 months and 11-12 months after infection using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay for 23 human coronavirus antigens including SARS-CoV-2 and its Variants of Concern (VOC) and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and additionally by three commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Results: Overall, 33.76% of SARS-CoV-2 exposed children and 57.88% adults were seropositive. Children were five times more likely to have seroconverted without symptoms compared to adults. Despite the frequently asymptomatic course of infection, children had higher specific antibody levels, and their antibodies persisted longer than in adults (96.22% versus 82.89% still seropositive 11-12 months post infection). Of note, symptomatic and asymptomatic infections induced similar humoral responses in all age groups. In symptomatic children, only dysgeusia was found as diagnostic indicator of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred independent of HCoV serostatus. Antibody binding responses to VOCs were similar in children and adults, with reduced binding for the Beta variant in both groups. Conclusions: The long-term humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is robust and may provide long-term protection even after asymptomatic infection.

328,28930,Highly versatile antibody binding assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Monitoring the burden and spread of infection with the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, whether within small communities or in large geographical settings, is of paramount importance for public health purposes. Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection. Here we show that our ELISA protocol, which is based on antibody binding to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral Spike protein expressed as a novel fusion protein, detects antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination.

We also show that our ELISA is accurate and versatile. It compares favorably with commercial assays widely used in clinical practice to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection. As a result, our RBD-based ELISA protocols are well suited for seroepidemiology and other large-scale studies requiring parsimonious sample collection outside of healthcare settings.",14/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.09.21260266,Maria Laura Gennaro,"Public Health Research Institute, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA",medrxiv,0,0,,

258,25885,Evolving Phenotypes of non-hospitalized Patients that Indicate Long Covid,"For some SARS-CoV-2 survivors, recovery from the acute phase of the infection has been grueling with lingering effects. Many of the symptoms characterized as the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) could have multiple causes or are similarly seen in non-COVID patients. Accurate identification of phenotypes will be important to guide future research and help the healthcare system focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age- and gender-specific sequelae of a COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective electronic health records (EHR) cohort study, we applied a computational framework for knowledge discovery from clinical data, MLHO, to identify phenotypes that positively associate with a past positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19. We evaluated the post-test phenotypes in two temporal windows at 3-6 and 6-9 months after the test and by age and gender. Data from longitudinal diagnosis records stored in EHRs from Mass General Brigham in the Boston metropolitan area was used for the analyses. Statistical analyses were performed on data from March 2020 to June 2021. Study participants included over 96 thousand patients who had tested positive or negative for COVID-19 and were not hospitalized. We identified 33 phenotypes among different age/gender cohorts or time windows that were positively associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. All identified phenotypes were newly recorded in patients' medical records two months or longer after a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in non-hospitalized patients regardless of the test result. Among these phenotypes, a new diagnosis record for anosmia and dysgeusia (OR: 2.60, 95% CI [1.94 - 3.46]), alopecia (OR: 3.09, 95% CI [2.53 - 3.76]), chest pain (OR: 1.27, 95% CI [1.09 - 1.48]), chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.22-2.10]), shortness of breath (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22 - 1.64]), pneumonia (OR 1.66, 95% CI [1.28 - 2.16]), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22 - 1.64]) are some of the most significant indicators of a past COVID-19 infection. Additionally, more new phenotypes were found with increased confidence among the cohorts who were younger than 65. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive discoveries while offering a more robust probabilistic approach compared to the standard linear phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). The findings of this study confirm many of the post-COVID symptoms and suggest that a variety of new diagnoses, including new diabetes mellitus and neurological disorder diagnoses, are more common among those with a history of COVID-19 than those without the infection. Additionally, more than 63 percent of PASC phenotypes were observed in patients under 65 years of age, pointing out the importance of vaccination to minimize the risk of debilitating post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 among younger adults.",10/07/2021,10.1101/2021.04.25.21255923,Hossein Estiri,Massachusetts General Hospital,medrxiv,0,0,,
321,28543,Reduced COVID-19 Hospitalizations among New York City Residents Following Age-Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Eligibility: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design,"BackgroundIn clinical trials, several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were shown to reduce risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Local, population-level, real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness is accumulating. We assessed vaccine effectiveness for community-dwelling New York City (NYC) residents using a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design, leveraging a period (January 12-March 9, 2021) when [&ge;]65-year-olds were vaccine-eligible but younger persons, excluding essential workers, were not.

MethodsWe constructed segmented, negative binomial regression models of age-specific COVID-19 hospitalization rates among 45-84-year-old NYC residents during a post-vaccination program implementation period (February 21-April 17, 2021), with a discontinuity at age 65 years. The relationship between age and hospitalization rates in an unvaccinated population was incorporated using a pre-implementation period (December 20, 2020-February 13, 2021). We calculated the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the interaction between implementation period (pre or post) and age-based eligibility (45-64 or 65-84 years). Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity and borough of residence. Similar analyses were conducted for COVID-19 deaths.

ResultsHospitalization rates among 65-84-year-olds decreased from pre- to post-implementation periods (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97), controlling for trends among 45-64-year-olds. Accordingly, an estimated 721 (95% CI: 126-1,241) hospitalizations were averted. Residents just above the eligibility threshold (65-66-year-olds) had lower hospitalization rates than those below (63-64-year-olds). Racial/ethnic groups and boroughs with higher vaccine coverage generally experienced greater reductions in RR point estimates. Uncertainty was greater for the decrease in COVID-19 death rates (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.10).

ConclusionThe vaccination program in NYC reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations among the initially age-eligible [&ge;]65-year-old population by approximately 15%.

323,28497,Evaluation of the United States COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy,"BackgroundAnticipating an initial shortage of vaccines for COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States developed priority vaccine allocations for specific demographic groups in the population. This study evaluates the performance of the CDC vaccine allocation strategy with respect to multiple potentially competing vaccination goals (minimizing mortality, cases, infections, and years of life lost (YLL)), under the same framework as the CDC allocation: four priority vaccination groups and population demographics stratified by age, comorbidities, occupation and living condition (congested or non-congested).

MethodsWe developed a compartmental disease model that incorporates key elements of the current pandemic including age-varying susceptibility to infection, age-varying clinical fraction, an active case-count dependent social distancing level, and time-varying infectivity (accounting for the emergence of more infectious virus strains). Under this model, the CDC allocation strategy is compared to all other possibly optimal allocations that stagger vaccine roll-out in up to four phases (17.5 million strategies).

ResultsThe CDC allocation strategy performed well in all vaccination goals but never optimally. Under the developed model, the CDC allocation deviated from the optimal allocations by small amounts, with 0.19% more deaths, 4.0% more cases, 4.07% more infections, and 0.97% higher YLL, than the respective optimal strategies. The CDC decision to not prioritize the vaccination of individuals under the age of 16 was optimal, as was the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers. Finally, a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes compared to the CDC allocation.

InterpretationThe developed approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States, or adapted for use by other countries seeking to optimize the effectiveness of their vaccine allocation strategies.

FundingThe authors received no funding for this work.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prioritized population groups for vaccination based on available scientific evidence, the feasibility of different implementation strategies, and ethical considerations. We searched PubMed using the query ""(((COVID) AND (vaccin*)) AND (model)) AND ((priorit*) OR alloc*)"" up to June 15, 2021, with no date or language restrictions. The search identified 190 articles, of which 15 used predictive models to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine allocation strategies in achieving vaccination campaign goals such as reducing mortality or incidence. All studies compared only a small number of specific, expertise-based allocations. Most studies stratified the population by age, while some considered additional characteristics such as occupation or comorbidity status, but none took into account all characteristics included in the CDC vaccine prioritizations.

Added value of this studyWe developed a compartmental disease model that takes into account several important components of the COVID-19 pandemic, and stratifies the U.S. population by all characteristics included in the CDC vaccine prioritization recommendations. In a novel global optimization approach, we compared the CDC recommendations to all potentially optimal strategies (17.5 million strategies) that also stagger the vaccine roll-out in four phases. The CDC allocation strategy performed well in all considered outcome measures, but never optimally; a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes. The CDC decision to initially not vaccinate children, as well as the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers proved optimal under all outcome measures.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study identifies and compares the optimal vaccine allocation strategies for several competing vaccination goals. The developed global optimization approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States and elsewhere.",05/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.01.21259870,Claus Kadelka,Iowa State University,medrxiv,0,0,,

Methods and analysisWe designed a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, two arm, exploratory study on healthy volunteers receiving the COVISHIELD vaccine. In addition to the two dose schedule of COVISHIELD vaccine as per national guidelines, participants will be administered 8gm Ashwagandha or placebo tablets respectively per day. Primary outcome measure is immunogenicity as measured by SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) and RBD-specific IgG antibody titres. Secondary outcome measures are safety, protective immune response and quality of life measures. Adverse event following immunization will be monitored at each time throughout the study. Participants will be tracked on a daily basis with a user friendly mobile phone application. Following power calculation 600 participants will be recruited per arm to demonstrate superiority by a margin of 7% with 80% power. Study duration is 28 weeks with interim analysis at the end of 12 weeks.

Ethics and disseminationEthical approval was obtained through the Central and institutional Ethics Committees. Participant recruitment is expected to commence by August 2021. Results will be presented in conferences and published in preprint followed by peer-reviewed medical journals.

326,28584,Covid-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review,"ObjectivePregnancy is a risk factor for severe Covid-19. Looking for safe vaccines that evoke protective maternal and fetal antibody response is important.

MethodsWe searched from registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO Clinical Trial Registry, and the EU Clinical Trial Registry) and databases (MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Proquest, and Springer) up until June 20, 2021. Articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria after duplicates were removed. Infection rate, maternal antibody response, placental antibody transfer, and adverse events were described. This systematic review was performed with quality assessment and semi-quantitative synthesis according to PRISMA guidelines.

ResultsTwelve observational studies with a total of 40.509 pregnant women included. The mRNA based vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) can prevent future SARS-CoV-2 infections (p=0.0004). Both vaccines did not affect pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. The most commonly encountered adverse reactions are injection-site pain, fatigue, and headache but only transient. Antibody responses were rapid after the prime dose of vaccines. After booster, antibody responses were higher and associated with better placental antibody transfer. Longer intervals between first vaccination dose and delivery were also associated with higher antibody fetal IgG and better antibody transfer ratio.

ConclusionsThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are efficacious for preventing future SARS-CoV-2 infections. These vaccines can be considered as a safe option for pregnancy and their fetus. Two doses of vaccines were recommended for more robust maternal and fetal antibody responses. Longer latency was associated with higher fetal antibody responses.

327,28719,Critical timing for triggering public health interventions to prevent COVID-19 resurgence: a mathematical modelling study,"To prevent the catastrophic health and economic consequences from COVID-19 epidemics, some nations have aimed for no community transmission outside of quarantine. To achieve this, governments have had to respond rapidly to outbreaks with public health interventions. But the exact characteristics of an outbreak that trigger these measures differ and are poorly defined. We used existing data from epidemics in Australia to establish a practical model to assist stakeholders in making decisions about the optimal timing and extent of interventions. We found that the number of reported cases on the day that interventions commenced strongly predicted the size of the outbreaks. We quantified how effective interventions were at containing outbreaks in relation to the number of cases at the time the interventions commenced. We also found that containing epidemics from novel variants that had higher transmissibility would require more stringent interventions that commenced earlier. In contrast, increasing vaccination coverage would enable more relaxed interventions. Our model highlights the importance of early and decisive action in the early phase of an outbreak if governments aimed for zero community transmission, although new variants and vaccination coverage may change this.",07/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.06.21260055,Lei Zhang,Melboune Sexual Health Centre,medrxiv,0,0,,
328,28739,COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations averted by rapid vaccination rollout in the United States,"ImportanceRandomized clinical trials have shown that the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the US are highly efficacious. However, more evidence is needed to understand the population-level impact of the US vaccination rollout in the face of the changing landscape of COVID-19 pandemic in the US, including variants with higher transmissibility and immune escape.

ObjectiveTo quantify the population-level impact of the US vaccination campaign in averting cases, hospitalizations and deaths from December 12, 2020 to June 28, 2021.

DesignAge-stratified agent-based model which included transmission dynamics of the Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants in addition to the original Wuhan-1 variant.

SettingOur model was calibrated to COVID-19 outbreak and vaccine rollout in the US. Model predictions were made at the country level.

ParticipantsSimulated age-stratified population representing US demographics.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases, hospitalizations and deaths averted by vaccination against COVID-19 in the US, compared to the counterfactuals of no vaccination and vaccination administered at half the actual pace.

ResultsThe swift vaccine rollout in the US curbed a potential resurgence of cases in April 2021, which would have been otherwise fuelled by the Alpha variant. Compared to the scenario without vaccines, we estimated that the actual vaccination program averted more than 26 million cases, 1.2 million hospitalizations and saved 279,000 lives. A vaccination campaign with half the actual rollout rate would have led to an additional 460,000 hospitalizations and 121,000 deaths.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US has had an extraordinary impact on reducing disease burden despite the emergence of highly transmissible variants. These findings highlight that the pace of vaccination was essential for mitigating COVID-19 in the US, and underscore the urgent need to close the vaccine coverage gaps in communities across the country.

329,28756,REACT-1 round 13 interim report: acceleration of SARS-CoV-2 Delta epidemic in the community in England during late June and early July 2021,"BackgroundDespite high levels of vaccination in the adult population, cases of COVID-19 have risen exponentially in England since the start of May 2021 driven by the Delta variant. However, with far fewer hospitalisations and deaths per case during the recent growth in cases compared with 2020, it is intended that all remaining social distancing legislation in England will be removed from 19 July 2021.

MethodsWe report interim results from round 13 of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a cross-sectional sample of the population of England was asked to provide a throat and nose swab for RT-PCR and to answer a questionnaire. Data collection for this report (round 13 interim) was from 24 June to 5 July 2021.

ResultsIn round 13 interim, we found 237 positives from 47,729 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 0.59% (0.51%, 0.68%) which was approximately four-fold higher compared with round 12 at 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). This resulted from continued exponential growth in prevalence with an average doubling time of 15 (13, 17) days between round 12 and round 13. However, during the recent period of round 13 interim only, we observed a shorter doubling time of 6.1 (4.0, 12) days with a corresponding R number of 1.87 (1.40, 2.45). There were substantial increases in all age groups under the age of 75 years, and especially at younger ages, with the highest prevalence in 13 to 17 year olds at 1.33% (0.97%, 1.82%) and in 18 to 24 years olds at 1.40% (0.89%, 2.18%). Infections have increased in all regions with the largest increase in London where prevalence increased more than eight-fold from 0.13% (0.08%, 0.20%) in round 12 to 1.08% (0.79%, 1.47%) in round 13 interim. Overall, prevalence was over 3 times higher in the unvaccinated compared with those reporting two doses of vaccine in both round 12 and round 13 interim, although there was a similar proportional increase in prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals between the two rounds.

DiscussionWe are entering a critical period with a number of important competing processes: continued vaccination rollout to the whole adult population in England, increased natural immunity through infection, reduced social mixing of children during school holidays, increased proportion of mixing occurring outdoors during summer, the intended full opening of hospitality and entertainment and cessation of mandated social distancing and mask wearing. Surveillance programmes are essential during this next phase of the epidemic to provide clear evidence to the government and the public on the levels and trends in prevalence of infections and their relationship to vaccine coverage, hospitalisations, deaths and Long COVID.",08/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.08.21260185,Steven Riley,"School of Public Health, Imperial College London, UK MRC Centre for Global infectious Disease Analysis and Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergenc",medrxiv,0,0,,
1,2593,Dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic at constant and time-dependent contact rates,"We constructed a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded model of the spread of COVID-19. The model is parametrised only by the average incubation period,{tau} , and two rate parameters: contact rate, rC, and exclusion rate, rE. The rates can be manipulated by non-therapeutic interventions and determine the basic reproduction number, R = rC/rE, and, together with{tau} , the daily multiplication coefficient at the early exponential phase, {beta}. Initial {beta} determines the reduction of rC required to contain epidemic spread. In the long-term, we consider a scenario based on typical social behaviours, in which rC first decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, forcing people to self-isolate, and then slowly increases when people gradually accept higher risk. Consequently, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, will grant time to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine, or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.",29/03/2020,10.1101/2020.03.13.20035485,Tomasz Lipniacki,Institute of Fundamental Technological Research,medrxiv,0,0,,
2,3043,Global profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses of convalescents using a proteome microarray,"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and has become a global pandemic. There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific IgG and IgM responses. However, the IgG/ IgM responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.

3,3761,A globally available COVID-19 - Template for clinical imaging studies,"BackgroundThe pandemic spread of COVID-19 has caused worldwide implications on societies and economies. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been found to support both, current diagnostic and disease monitoring. A joint approach to collect, analyze and share clinical and imaging information about COVID-19 in the highest quality possible is urgently needed.

MethodsAn evidence-based reporting template was developed for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia using an FDA-approved medical software. The annotation of qualitative and quantitative findings including radiomics features is performed directly on primary imaging data. For data collection, secondary information from the patient history and clinical data such as symptoms and comorbidities are queried.

ResultsLicense-royalty free, cloud-based web platform and on-premise deployments are offered. Hospitals can upload, assess, report and if pseudonymized share their COVID-19 cases. The aggregation of radiomics in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically documented in a single database, will lead to optimized diagnosis, risk stratification and response evaluation. A customizable analytics dashboard allows the explorative real-time data analysis of imaging features and clinical information.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19-Template is based on a systematic, computer-assisted and context-guided approach to collect, analyze and share data. Epidemiological and clinical studies for therapies and vaccine candidates can be implemented in compliance with high data quality, integrity and traceability.

4,3796,Repurposing Therapeutics for COVID-19: Rapid Prediction of Commercially available drugs through Machine Learning and Docking,"BackgroundThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods and findingsWe perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID - DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions.

ConclusionsOur study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.

5,4171,Nitric oxide gas inhalation to prevent COVID-2019 in healthcare providers,"IntroductionIn human hosts, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome (named COVID-19) which can range from a mild involvement of the upper airways to a severe pneumonia with acute respiratory syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated transmission is an important route of spreading for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and healthcare providers are at the highest risk. As of February 2020, 1716, Chinese healthcare workers had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and at least 6 died. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or pharmacological prophylaxis to decrease the risk of healthcare providers contracting the infection.

Methods and analysisWe will randomize 470 healthcare providers scheduled to work with COVID 19 patients to receive nitric oxide gas administration (NO group, n=235) or no gas administration (control group, n=235). The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of subjects with COVID-19 disease at 14 days from enrollment. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of healthcare providers who present a positive real time RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV- 2 14 days after enrollment, the proportion of healthcare providers requiring quarantine, and the total number of quarantine days in the two groups.

Ethics and disseminationThe trial protocol is under the approval of The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) and recruitment is expected to start in April 2020.

6,4163,Association Between BCG Policy is Significantly Confounded by Age and is Unlikely to Alter Infection or Mortality Rates,"Recently a number of publications looked at the association between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on one hand and countries policies with respect to BCG vaccination on the other. This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the ""known immunological benefits"" of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation.

One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection).

Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context.

This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.",11/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055616,Stefan Kirov,Bristol Myers Squibb,medrxiv,0,0,,

Two recent studies have suggested a link between the BCG vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. In the present study we compared the impact of COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high disease burden and those with BCG revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe COVID-19. We found a significant difference in the CFR between the two groups of countries. Our data further supports the view that universal BCG vaccination has a protective effect on the course of COVID-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death. Clinical trials of BCG vaccine are urgently needed to establish its beneficial role in COVID-19 as suggested by the epidemiological data, especially in countries without a universal BCG vaccination policy.",19/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.07.20053272,Devi Dayal,"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India",medrxiv,0,0,,
8,4183,Efficacy of remdesivir versus placebo for the treatment of COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BackgroundIn spite of the global containment on prevention efforts, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuing to rise, with 1.1 million confirmed cases and 60,124 deaths recorded worldwide since 04 April 2020. The outbreak has a significant threat to international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19.

Method and analysisWe will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo.

9,4190,Estimating Probabilities of Success of Clinical Trials for Vaccines and Other Anti-Infective Therapeutics,"A key driver in biopharmaceutical investment decisions is the probability of success of a drug development program. We estimate the probabilities of success (PoS) of clinical trials for vaccines and other anti-infective therapeutics using 43,414 unique triplets of clinical trial, drug, and disease between January 1, 2000, and January 7, 2020, yielding 2,544 vaccine programs and 6,829 non-vaccine programs targeting infectious diseases. The overall estimated PoS for an industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6%, and 16.3% for an industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against monkeypox (100%), rotavirus (78.7%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6%). The three infectious diseases with the highest PoS for industry-sponsored non-vaccine therapeutics are smallpox (100%), CMV (31.8%), and onychomycosis (29.8%). Non-industry-sponsored vaccine and non-vaccine development programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8% and 8.2%, respectively. Viruses involved in recent outbreaks--MERS, SARS, Ebola, Zika--have had a combined total of only 45 non-vaccine development programs initiated over the past two decades, and no approved therapy to date (Note: our data was obtained just before the COVID-19 outbreak and do not contain information about the programs targeting this disease.) These estimates offer guidance both to biopharma investors as well as to policymakers seeking to identify areas most likely to be undeserved by private-sector engagement and in need of public-sector support.",14/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059600,Andrew W Lo,MIT,medrxiv,0,0,,

We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model--which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives--to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0 = 2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.",14/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059634,Andrew W Lo,MIT,medrxiv,0,0,,
11,4315,Molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs and traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19: A systematic scoping review,"BackgroundThe emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic has resulted in the need for urgent development of vaccines and drugs and the conduction of clinical trials to fight the outbreak. Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19.

ObjectiveThe objective of this systematic scoping review is to provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease.

Data SourcesThe research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 4 traditional Chinese medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) were extracted.

ConclusionsAll of the repurposed drugs that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

DesignMulticenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Setting16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020.

Participants150 patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone.

InterventionsHCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively).

Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone.

ResultsAmong 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days ({+/-} standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 ({+/-}10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non-recipients (N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events.

ConclusionsThe administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non-recipients.

What is already known on this topic-- The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposes substantial burdens on individuals, communities, health-care facilities, markets, governments, etc. globally.
-- There is no specific treatment approved for COVID-19 or vaccine to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus.
-- During the urgent pandemic, media headlines the utility of drugs without solid evidence but buries the side-effects of these drugs.


What this study adds-- In this randomized clinical trial of patients mainly with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19, exposure to hydroxychloroquine led to a similar probability of virus elimination comparing to the current standard-of-care.
-- Adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal related, were significantly increased in patients who received hydroxychloroquine.
-- Overall, the results from our trial do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19.

13,4402,Identifying common pharmacotherapies associated with reduced COVID-19 morbidity using electronic health records,"ObjectiveAbsent a vaccine or any established treatments for the novel and highly infectious coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), rapid efforts to identify potential therapeutics are required. We sought to identify commonly prescribed medications that may be associated with lesser risk of morbidity with COVID-19 across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals.

DesignIn silico cohort using electronic health records from individuals evaluated in the emergency department between March 4, 2020 and July 12, 2020.

SettingEmergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals.

ParticipantsAll individuals presenting to an emergency department and undergoing COVID-19 testing.

Main Outcome or MeasureInpatient hospitalization; documented requirement for mechanical ventilation.

ResultsAmong 7,360 individuals with COVID-19 positive test results by PCR, 3,693 (50.2%) were hospitalized in one of 6 hospitals. In models adjusted for sociodemographic features and overall burden of medical illness, medications significantly associated with diminished risk for hospitalization included ibuprofen and sumatriptan. Among individuals who were hospitalized, 962(26.0%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 608 (16.5%) died; ibuprofen and naproxen were also more commonly prescribed among individuals not requiring intensive care.

ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that electronic health records may be applied to identify medications associated with lower risk of morbidity with COVID-19, but larger cohorts will be required to address the substantial problem of confounding by indication, such that extreme caution is warranted in interpreting nonrandomized results.

14,4605,Epidemic Landscape and Forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 in India,"BACKGROUNDIndia was one of the countries to institute strict measures for SARS-CoV-2 control in early phase. Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions.

METHODSWe estimated growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowd sourced time series data. Further, we also estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and time dependent reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models.

RESULTSOn an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14 {+/-} 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% of population likely to be infected at the peak time.

CONCLUSIONSThe pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase fund for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a medicine.",17/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.14.20065151,Muhammed Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya,"School of Public Health, Boston University, MA, USA",medrxiv,0,0,,
15,4778,"Epidemiological and Genomic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Ten Patients from a Mid-sized City outside of Hubei, China in the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak","A novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we performed a comprehensive epidemiological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from ten patients in Shaoxing, a mid-sized city outside of the epicenter Hubei province, China, during the early stage of the outbreak (late January to early February, 2020). We obtained viral genomes with > 99% coverage and a mean depth of 296X demonstrating that viral genomic analysis is feasible via metagenomics sequencing directly on nasopharyngeal samples with SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR Ct values less than 28. We found that a cluster of 4 patients with travel history to Hubei shared the exact same virus with patients from Wuhan, Taiwan, Belgium and Australia, highlighting how quickly this virus spread to the globe. The virus from another cluster of two family members living together without travel history but with a sick contact of a confirmed case from another city outside of Hubei accumulated significantly more mutations (9 SNPs vs average 4 SNPs), suggesting a complex and dynamic nature of this outbreak. We also found 70% patients in this study had the S genotype, consistent with an early study showing a higher prevalence of genotype out of Hubei than that inside Hubei. We calculated an average mutation rate of 1.37x10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year, which is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Our findings add to the growing knowledge of the epidemiological and genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 that are important for guiding outbreak containment and vaccine development. The moderate mutation rate of this virus also lends hope that development of an effective, long-lasting vaccine may be possible.",02/06/2020,10.1101/2020.04.16.20058560,Shangxin Yang,UCLA Health System,medrxiv,0,0,,
16,4860,Review of Current Evidence of Hydroxychloroquine in Pharmacotherapy of COVID-19,"ImportanceThe COVID-19 Pandemic has literally left the world breathless in the chase for pharmacotherapy. With vaccine and novel drug development in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage.

ObjectiveA potential drug discussed in global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine. We intend to systematically explore, analyze, rate the existing evidence of hydroxychloroquine in the light of published, unpublished and clinical trial data.

Evidence reviewPubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases, pre-proof article repositories, clinical trial registries were comprehensively searched with focused question of use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. The literature was systematically explored as per PRISMA guidelines.

FindingsTotal 156 articles were available as of 7th May 2020; of which 11 articles of relevance were analyzed. Three in-vitro studies were reviewed. Two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one large observational study, one follow-up study and two retrospective cohort studies were systematically analyzed and rated by oxford CEBM and GRADE framework for quality and strength of evidence. Also 27 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed and summarized. Hydroxychloroquine seems to be efficient in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines. However, there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. It was found that overall quality of available evidence ranges from  very low to  low.

Conclusions and relevanceThe in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Current literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the current evidence for use of Hydroxychloroquine in pharmacotherapy of COVID-19?

FindingsWe electronically explored various databases and clinical trial registries and identified 11 publications and 27 clinical trials with active recruitment. The in-vitro study data demonstrates the viral inhibition by hydroxychloroquine. The clinical studies are weakly designed and conducted with insufficient reporting and significant limitations. Well designed robust clinical trials are being conducted all over the world and results of few such robust studies are expected shortly.

17,4966,Self-burnout - a new path to the end of COVID-19,"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe a possible route to the end of COVID-19, which does not feature either vaccination or herd immunity. We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the regions population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.",28/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069443,B Shayak,Cornell University,medrxiv,0,0,,
18,5123,Immune defects and cardiovascular risk in X chromosome monosomy mosaicism mediated by loss of chromosome Y. A risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 vulnerability in elderly men?,"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) has an estimated overall case fatality ratio of 1.38% in China, being 53% higher in males and increasing exponentially with age. Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down-regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10-7), mainly interferon-induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease.",24/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.19.20071357,Juan R Gonzalez,Barcelona Institute for Global Health,medrxiv,0,0,,
19,5069,"Evidence-Based, Cost-Effective Interventions To Suppress The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","BackgroundIn an unparalleled global response, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 90 countries asked 3.9 billion people to stay home. Yet some countries avoided lockdowns and focused on other strategies, like contact tracing and case isolation. How effective and cost-effective are these strategies? We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on pandemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness.

MethodsFollowing PRISMA systematic review guidelines, MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2020) and Embase (1974 to April 17, 2020) were searched using a range of terms related to pandemic control. Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher-quality evidence (randomized trials) and lower-quality evidence (other study designs).

ResultsWe found 1,653 papers; 62 were included. Higher-quality evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies indicated that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other interventions, lower-quality evidence suggested that: (1) the most cost-effective interventions are swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost-effective; (3) social distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost-effective options; (4) combinations are more cost-effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost-effective when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented).

ConclusionsA cautious interpretation of the evidence suggests that for COVID-19: (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, ample protective equipment for healthcare workers, and swift contact tracing and case isolation is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.

20,5306,Long period dynamics of viral load and antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 infection: an observational cohort study,"OBJECTIVETo investigate the dynamics of viral RNA, IgM, and IgG and their relationships in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia over an 8-week period.

DESIGNRetrospective, observational case series.

SETTINGWenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital

PARTICIPANTSThirty-three patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to hospital. Data were collected from January 27 to April 10, 2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThroat swabs, sputum, stool, and blood samples were collected, and viral load was measured by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific IgM and IgG against spike protein (S), spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) were analyzed.

RESULTSAt the early stages of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 viral load is higher in throat swabs and sputum, but lower in stool. The median (IQR) time of undetectable viral RNA in throat swab, sputum, and stool was 18.5 (13.25-22) days, 22 (18.5-27.5) days, and 17 (11.5-32) days, respectively. In sputum, 17 patients (51.5%) had undetectable viral RNA within 22 days (short persistence), and 16 (48.5%) had persistent viral RNA more than 22 days (long persistence). Three patients (9.1%) had a detectable relapse of viral RNA in sputum within two weeks of their discharge from the hospital. One patient had persistent viral RNA for 59 days or longer. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgM, anti-RBD IgM, and anti-N IgM was 10.5 (7.75-15.5) days, 14 (9-24) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-N IgG was 10 (7.25-16.5) days, 13 (9-17) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. By week 8 after symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels were 4-times higher in convalescence than in acute phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA coexisted with antibodies for more than 50 days. Anti-RBD IgM and IgG levels, including anti-RBD IgM levels at presentation and peak time, were significantly higher in viral RNA short persistence patients than in long persistence patients.

CONCLUSIONThis study adds important new information about the features of viral load and antibody dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It is clear from these results that the viral RNA persists in sputum and stool specimens for a relatively long time in many patients. Anti-RBD may also serve as a potential protective antibody against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as viral persistence appears to be related to anti-RBD levels. Earlier treatment intervention also appears to be a factor in viral persistence.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICThere are several reports about the serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. However, most of them evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Only two articles report dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and antibodies with serial samples, but the observation periods are within 30 days. None of the studies investigate the profiles of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and antibodies in a long period. Three reports investigate profiles in respiratory samples, but there are no reports on the dynamics of the viral load in stool samples.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSIn both sputum and stool, SARS-CoV-2 RNA persists for a long time. The anti-RBD antibodies may involve in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. After eight weeks from symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels increased 4-time higher in convalescence than in acute phase. Long persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in sputum and stool presents challenges for management of the infection. The IgM/IgG comb test is better than single IgM test as a supplement diagnostic tool. Anti-RBD may be a protective antibody, and is valuable for development of vaccines.",27/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.22.20071258,Shaohua Tang,"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital",medrxiv,0,0,,
21,5347,Intention to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial and to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France during the pandemic,"BackgroundThe world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of vaccine is challenging.

AimTo determine the proportion of people who intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial.

MethodsWe conducted an anonymous on-line survey from the 26th of March to the 20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical trial.

ResultsThree thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the survey; women accounted for 67.4 % of the responders, 670 (20.6 %) were under 30 years of age, 1,502 (46.1 %) between 30-49 years, 803 (24.6 %) between 50-64 years, 271 (8.3%) between 65-80 years, 13 (0.4%) over 80 years of age. According to their statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95 % CI 76.2-79 %) will certainly or probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, being healthcare workers and individual perceived risk were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred and fifty responders (47.6 % 95 % CI 45.9-49.3 %) will certainly or probably agree to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.

Conclusions and RelevanceNearly 75 % and 48 % of the survey responders were likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against COVID-19.

22,5607,Custommune: a web tool to design personalized and population-targeted vaccine epitopes,"Computational prediction of immunogenic epitopes is a promising platform for therapeutic and preventive vaccine design. A potential target for this strategy is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), for which, despite decades of efforts, no vaccine is available. In particular, a therapeutic vaccine devised to eliminate infected cells would represent a key component of cure strategies. HIV peptides designed based on individual viro-immunological data from people living with HIV/AIDS have recently shown able to induce post-therapy viral set point abatement. However, the reproducibility and scalability of this method is curtailed by the errors and arbitrariness associated with manual peptide design as well as by the time-consuming process.

We herein introduce Custommune, a user-friendly web tool to design personalized and population-targeted vaccines. When applied to HIV-1, Custommune predicted personalized epitopes using patient specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and viral sequences, as well as the expected HLA-peptide binding strength and potential immune escape mutations. Of note, Custommune predictions compared favorably with manually designed peptides administered in a recent phase II clinical trial (NCT02961829).

Furthermore, we utilized Custommune to design preventive vaccines targeted for populations highly affected by COVID-19. The results allowed the identification of peptides tailored for each population and predicted to elicit both CD8+ T-cell immunity and neutralizing antibodies against structurally conserved epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Overall, our data describe a new tool for rapid development of personalized or population-based immunotherapy against chronic and acute viral infections.",29/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079426,Andrea Savarino,"Department of Infectious Diseases, Italian Institute of Health, Rome, Italy",medrxiv,0,0,,
23,5669,Population-scale testing can suppress the spread of COVID-19,"We propose an additional intervention that would contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, offer more protection for people working in essential jobs, and help guide an eventual reopening of society. The intervention is based on: (1) testing every individual (2) repeatedly, and (3) self-quarantine of infected individuals. Using a standard epidemiological model (SIR), we show here that by identification and isolation of the majority of infectious individuals, including those who may be asymptomatic, the reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. We replicate these observations in a more complex stochastic dynamic model on a social network graph. We also find that the testing regime would be additive to other interventions, and be effective at any level of prevalence. If adopted as a policy, any industrial society could sustain the regime for as long as it takes to find a safe and effective cure or vaccine. Our model also indicates that unlike sampling-based tests, population-scale testing does not need to be very accurate: false negative rates up to 15% could be tolerated if 80% comply with testing every ten days, and false positives can be almost arbitrarily high when a high fraction of the population is already effectively quarantined. Testing at the required scale would be feasible if existing qPCR-based methods are scaled up and multiplexed. A mass produced, low throughput field test kit could also be carried out at home. Economic analysis also supports the feasibility of the approach: current reagent costs for tests are in the range of a dollar or less, and the estimated benefits for population-scale testing are so large that the policy would be cost-effective even if the costs were larger by more than two orders of magnitude. To identify both active and previous infections, both viral RNA and antibodies could be tested. All technologies to build such test kits, and to produce them in the scale required to test the entire worlds population exist already. Integrating them, scaling up production, and implementing the testing regime will require resources and planning, but at a scale that is very small compared to the effort that every nation would devote to defending itself against a more traditional foe.",28/05/2020,10.1101/2020.04.27.20078329,Sten Linnarsson,Karolinska Institutet,medrxiv,0,0,,
24,6574,BCG Vaccine Protection from Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19),"A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; p = 8x10-7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating in recent history. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis also confers broad protection against other infectious diseases, and it has been proposed that it could reduce the severity of COVID-19. This epidemiological study assessed the global linkage between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality. Signals of BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. This study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.",14/06/2020,10.1101/2020.05.05.20091975,Carolina Barillas-Mury,National Institutes of Health,medrxiv,0,0,,
25,6560,ProgNet: Covid-19 prognosis using recurrent andconvolutional neural networks,"--Humanity is facing nowadays a dramatic pandemic episode with the Coronavirus propagation over all continents. The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either therapeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagery-based tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase.

Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology. When applied to radiological time-series, promising results are obtained with an accuracy rates higher than 92%.",08/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874,Lotfi Chaari,Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse,medrxiv,0,0,,
26,6658,"Treatments administered to the first 9,152 reported cases of COVID19: a systematic review","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2/2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19) has created a global pandemic with no approved treatments or vaccines. Many treatments have already been administered to COVID19 patients but have not been systematically evaluated. We performed a systematic literature review to identify all treatments reported to be administered to COVID19 patients and assess time to clinically meaningful response for treatments with sufficient data. We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv for articles reporting treatments for COVID19 patients published between 12/1/2019-3/27/2020. Data were analyzed descriptively. Of the 2,706 articles identified, 155 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 9,152 patients from 14 different countries. The cohort was 45.4% female and 98.3% hospitalized and mean (SD) age was 44.4 years (SD 21.0). The most frequently administered drug classes were antivirals, antibiotics, and corticosteroids, and of the 115 reported drugs, the most frequently administered was combination lopinavir/ritonavir, which was associated with a time to clinically-meaningful response (complete symptom resolution or hospital discharge) of 11.7 (1.09) days. There was insufficient data to compare across treatments. A large number of treatments have been administered to the first 9,152 reported cases of COVID19. These data serve as the basis for an open-source registry of all reported treatments given to COVID19 patients.

27,6777,DOUBLE POWER LAW FOR COVID-19: PREDICTION OF NEW CASES AND DEATH RATES IN ITALY AND SPAIN,"1.The novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 appeared at the end of 2019, spreading rapidly and causing a severe respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) with high mortality (2-5%). Until a vaccine or therapy is found, the most effective method of prophylaxis has been to minimize transmission via rigorous social distancing and seclusion of all but essential workers. Such measures, implemented at different times and to varying degrees world-wide, have reduced the rate of transmission compared with early phases of the pandemic, resulting in ""flattening of the curve"" followed by a gradual reduction in mortality after >6 weeks of rigorous social distancing measures. The cost of rigorous social distancing has been seen in radically reduced economic activity, job losses, disruption of schooling and social institutions. A key question facing policy makers and individuals is when to resume normal economic and social activity in the face of persistent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To help address this question, we have developed a model that accurately describes the entire transmission and mortality curves in Italy and Spain, two hard-hit countries that have maintained severe social distancing measures for over 2 months. Our model quantitatively describes the rapid rise and slow decay of new cases and deaths observed under stringent social distancing (the ""long tail"" effect). We predict that even when social distancing is rigorously maintained, the number of COVID-19 deaths after peak mortality may be 2 - 3 times larger than the total number of deaths up to the peak. Our model has important policy implications for countries currently debating how to ease social distancing measures.",23/10/2020,10.1101/2020.05.07.20094714,Lev Z.

28,7003,Health literacy of inland population in the mitigation phase 3.2. of COVID-19's pandemic in Portugal - a descriptive cohort study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted through respiratory droplets with a high transmission rate. Theres still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, thus, preventive measures are the main key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and how to prevent the lack of information, through community empowerment.

Material and methodsA cross-sectional study with a cohort from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.

ResultsOur cohort includes 222 subjects (median age: 62 years old), mostly females (131), undergraduate (193) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (144). Globally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group appear to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions to this pattern.

ConclusionsWe observe a well-informed population. However, being a pandemic situation, we intend to identify and correct outliers/misconceptions. This work allows a perspective of the current state/pattern of health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, this study makes aware of how relevant the specific communication approaches are. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are necessary.",14/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.11.20098061,Joana Gomes Da Silva,Centro de Saude Mirandela II,medrxiv,0,0,,
29,7110,Country-level Determinants of the Severity of the First Global Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Ecological Study,"ObjectiveWe aimed to identify the country-level determinants of the severity of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignAn ecological study design of publicly available data was employed. Countries reporting >25 COVID-related deaths until 08/06/2020 were included. The outcome was log mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential determinants assessed were most recently published demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, median age, average body mass index, smoking prevalence), Economic parameters (Gross Domestic Product per capita); environmental parameters: pollution levels, mean temperature (January-May)), co-morbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer), health system parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10,000 population); international arrivals, the stringency index, as a measure of country-level response to COVID-19, BCG vaccination coverage, UV radiation exposure and testing capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data.

Primary OutcomeCountry-level mean mortality rate: the mean slope of the COVID-19 mortality curve during its ascending phase.

ParticipantsThirty-seven countries were included: Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.

ResultsOf all country-level predictors included in the multivariable model, total number of international arrivals (beta 0.033 (95% Confidence Interval 0.012,0.054)) and BCG vaccination coverage (-0.018 (-0.034,-0.002)), were significantly associated with the mean death rate.

ConclusionsInternational travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Very early restrictions on international travel should be considered to control COVID outbreak and prevent related deaths.

ARTICLE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSStrengths and limitationsC_ST_ABSO_LIA comparable and relevant outcome variable quantifying country-level increases in the COVID-19 death rate was derived which is largely independent of different testing policies adopted by each country

30,7215,Proinflammatory IgG Fc structures in patients with severe COVID-19,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused a public health crisis that is exacerbated by our poor understanding of correlates of immunity. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic carriage to life threatening pneumonia and cytokine dysregulation [1-3]. Although antibodies have been shown in a variety of in vitro assays to promote coronavirus infections through mechanisms requiring interactions between IgG antibodies and Fc gamma receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs), the relevance of these observations to coronavirus infections in humans is not known [4-7]. In light of ongoing clinical trials examining convalescent serum therapy for COVID-19 patients and expedited SARS-CoV-2 vaccine testing in humans, it is essential to clarify the role of antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we show that adults with PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 produce IgG antibodies with a specific Fc domain repertoire that is characterized by reduced fucosylation, a modification that enhances interactions with the activating Fc{gamma}R, Fc{gamma}RIIIa. Fc fucosylation was reduced when compared with SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children and relative to adults with symptomatic influenza virus infections. These results demonstrate an antibody correlate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting Fc{gamma}RIIIa pathways.",10/11/2020,10.1101/2020.05.15.20103341,Taia T.

31,7611,Immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 spike in individuals recovered from COVID-19,"The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant mortality and social disruption have highlighted the need to better understand coronavirus immunity to expedite vaccine development efforts. Multiple candidate vaccines, designed to elicit protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein, are rapidly advancing to clinical trial. However, the immunogenic properties of the spike protein in humans are unresolved. To address this, we undertook an in-depth characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike in humans following mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find serological antibody responses against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising activity and capacity to block ACE2/RBD interaction. Expanded populations of spike-specific memory B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) were detected within convalescent donors, while responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) constitute a minor fraction. Using regression analysis, we find high plasma neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody, but notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets. Thus both qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immunity to spike constitute informative biomarkers of the protective potential of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",21/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.17.20104869,Adam K Wheatley,University of Melbourne,medrxiv,0,0,,
32,8098,Tensions between research and public health: modelling the risks and benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine field trials versus human infection challenge studies.,"BackgroundHuman infection challenge studies (HICS) with SARS-CoV-2 are under consideration as a way of accelerating vaccine development. We evaluate potential vaccine research strategies under a range of epidemic conditions determined, in part, by the intensity of public health interventions.

MethodsWe constructed a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating public health interventions, vaccine efficacy trials and a post-trial population vaccination campaign. The model was used to estimate the duration and benefits of large-scale field trials in comparison with HICS accompanied by an expanded safety trial, and to assess the marginal risk faced by HICS participants.

ResultsField trials may demonstrate vaccine efficacy more rapidly than a HICS strategy under epidemic conditions consistent with moderate mitigation policies. A HICS strategy is the only feasible option for testing vaccine efficacy under epidemic suppression, and maximises the benefits of post-trial vaccination. Less successful or absent mitigation results in minimal or no benefit from post-trial vaccination, irrespective of trial design.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 HICS are the optimal method of vaccine testing for populations maintained under epidemic suppression, where vaccination offers the greatest benefits to the local population.",27/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.18.20106187,George S Heriot,Monash University,medrxiv,0,0,,

DesignRapid systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2.

Data sourcesClinicalTrials.gov, World health organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Cochrane COVID registry were assessed till May 11th 2020.

Study selectionStudies on any intervention based randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective clinical studies on SARS-CoV-2 in patients [&ge;]18 years of age. Studies on autopsy series, preclinical studies, diagnostic methods, mathematical modelling, epidemiology and health services research, pediatric populations were excluded.

Data extractionThe data was extracted by two authors independently into pre-defined forms based on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The data was extracted on various domains such as trial number, study title, abstract of the study, interventions assessed, sample size, phase of the study, study sponsor, primary endpoint assessed and country of study.

ResultsThe search resulted in 3242 ongoing studies of which 829 studies were included. There are 134 different drug-based interventions being assessed in 463 clinical trials as treatment options. Seventy-two studies assessed preventive options of which 53 are drug-based prophylaxis and 19 assessed vaccines. Herbal medicines are being assessed in 79 studies; convalescent plasma therapy in 56 studies; stem cell-based interventions in 42 studies; anesthesia-based interventions in 31 studies, machine-based interventions in 24 studies, mental health-based interventions in18 studies, rehabilitation-based interventions in 12 studies and miscellaneous interventions in 32 studies. China accounts for 35% of all ongoing clinical studies followed by USA 23%, France 7%, Spain 3.3%,Canada 2%, multi-country studies account only for 1.5% (13) and other countries together account for 28%.Amongst the 463 studies assessing drug-based treatment options, studies that are funded by federal and academic institutions are 79.6%, pharmaceutical company funded studies are 15.11% and no funding information is available in 5.10%. The definitive outcomes like mortality are being assessed as primary outcome in 22.8% of the studies only and need for ventilator in 6.2% of the studies. Rest of the studies has primary outcomes such as clinical recovery (15.9%), viral clearance(17.4%), time to recovery (10.1%), oxygen improvement (5.6%), ICU admission (1.9%), lab and imaging(6.4%), adverse effects (5.3%) and symptom reduction(1.5%),no outcome reported(6.2%) which account for 71% of the studies. Amongst the pharmaceutical company funded drug-based studies, only 20% of the studies had mortality as the primary outcome. Only 5.5% of the ongoing clinical trials are specifically designed to assess the most vulnerable population like elderly, patients with comorbidities and cancer. The most common intervention being tested against COVID-19 are antimalarial medications with 105 clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine is the most common drug being tested with 83 ongoing studies.

ConclusionMultiple intervention based clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2 are being performed throughout the world with a high concentration of clinical trials in the developed world. There is a high concern that most of the studies maybe repetitive; elderly and patients with comorbidities are being underrepresented; definite endpoints like mortality are being assessed in only one-fifth of the studies.",26/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.24.20112169,Bhanu Prasad Venkatesulu,Henry Ford Hospital,medrxiv,0,0,,
34,8237,Improved detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 by microsphere-based antibody assay,"ObjectiveCurrently available COVID-19 antibody tests using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunochromatographic assay have variable sensitivity and specificity. Here, we developed and evaluated a novel microsphere-based antibody assay (MBA) for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD).

MethodWe developed a microsphere-based assay (MBA) to determine the levels of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 NP and spike RBD. The seropositive cut-off mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was set using a cohort of 294 anonymous serum specimens collected in 2018. The specificity was assessed using serum specimens collected from organ donors or influenza patients before 2020. Seropositive rate was determined among patients with COVID-19. Time-to-seropositivity and signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio were compared between MBA and EIA.

ResultsMBA had a specificity of 100% (93/93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96-100%) for anti-NP IgG and 98.9% (92/93; 95% CI 94.2-100%) for anti-RBD IgG. The MBA seropositive rate for convalescent serum specimens of COVID-19 patients were 89.8% (35/39) for anti-NP IgG and 79.5% (31/39) for anti-RBD IgG. The time-to-seropositivity was shorter with MBA than that of EIA. When compared with EIA, MBA could better differentiate between COVID-19 patients and negative controls with significantly higher S/CO ratio for COVID-19 patients and lower S/CO ratio with negative controls. MBA also had fewer specimens in the equivocal range (S/CO 0.9-1.1) than EIA.

ConclusionMBA is robust and simple, and is suitable for clinical microbiology laboratory for the accurate determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody for retrospective diagnosis, serosurveillance, and vaccine trials.",26/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.26.20113191,Kelvin Kai-Wang To,University of Hong Kong,medrxiv,0,0,,
35,8299,The Potential Impact of Intensified Community Hand Hygiene Interventions on Respiratory tract Infections: A Modelling Study,"Increased hand hygiene amongst the general public has been widely promoted as one of the most important non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing transmission during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and is likely to continue to play a key role in long-term efforts to suppress transmission before a vaccine can be deployed. For other respiratory tract infections community hand hygiene interventions are supported by evidence from randomised trials, but information on how effectiveness in reducing transmission scales with achieved changes in hand hygiene behaviour is lacking. This information is of critical importance when considering the potential value of substantially enhancing community hand hygiene frequency to help suppress COVID-19. Here, we developed a simple model-based framework for understanding the key determinants of the effectiveness of changes in hand hygiene behaviour in reducing transmission and use it to explore the potential impact of interventions aimed at achieving large-scale population-wide changes in hand hygiene behaviour. Our analyses show that the effect of hand hygiene is highly dependent on the duration of viral persistence on hands and that hand washing needs to be performed very frequently or immediately after hand contamination events in order to substantially reduce the probability of infection. Hand washing at a lower frequency, such as every 30 minutes or with a delay of 15 minutes after contamination events, may be adequate to reduce the probability of infection when viral survival on hands is longer, such as when hands are contaminated with mucus. Immediate hand washing after contamination is more effective than hand washing at fixed-time intervals even when the total number of hand washing events is similar. This event-prompted hand washing strategy is consistently more effective than fixed-time strategy regardless of hand contamination rates and should be highlighted in hand hygiene campaigns.",27/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.26.20113464,Thi Mui Pham,Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care of the UMC Utrecht,medrxiv,0,0,,
36,8747,THE TIME TO OFFER TREATMENT FOR COVID-19,"BACKGROUNDThe spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan China, has been alarmingly rapid. Epidemiologic techniques succeeded in containing the disease in China, but efforts have not been as successful in the rest of the World, with a total of 29,155,581 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 926,544 deaths worldwide as of September 15, 2020. Projections are for continued new infections and deaths if no effective therapeutic interventions can be initiated over the next several months. We performed a systematic review to determine the potential time course for development of treatments and vaccines, focusing on availability now and continuing in the last half of 2020.

METHODS

Clinical TrialsWe reviewed up-to-date information from several sources to identify potential treatments for COVID-19: The Reagan-Udall Expanded Access Navigator COVID-19 Treatment Hub was used to track the efforts of companies to develop agents. We focused on trials completed as of September 1, 2020 on identified agents We used several different sources: (A) covid-trials.org, then validated results on (B) clinicaltrials.gov and the (C) World Health Organizations International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). We excluded studies which were clearly observational, with no randomization, control, or comparison group. We further set a cutoff of 100 for numbers of subjects, since smaller trial size could lack statistical power to establish superiority of the intervention over the control.

PublicationsWe searched for published trial results on pubmed.gov and on medRxiv, the preprint server, and used a targeted Google search to find announcements of unpublished trial results

RESULTS

Clinical Trials in RecruitmentAs of our cutoff date of April 1, 2020, we found 409 trials meeting our minimum requirement of 100 subjects. The WHO Solidarity megatrial for hospitalized patients was launched in over 100 countries, actively comparing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopanovir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone and in combination with interferon beta-1, and remdesivir. The LPV/r alone and HCQ arms have already been discontinued. Of these, only 9 were conducted on outpatients. A few vaccine trials are hoping to complete Phase 3 enrollment by the end of the third quarter 2020, but a prolonged follow-up of patients will likely be required.

Clinical trials CompletedAs of September 1, 2020, there were 231 trials reporting completion, Of these, only 59 studies enrolled 100 or more subjects. There were 34 trials in hospitalized patients, 9 directed at outpatients, and 8 prevention studies,

Published DataAs of September 1, 2020 we found 70 publications reporting findings in human studies on 13 classes of drugs and on 6 vaccines. There were 33 randomized placebo or active control studies; the rest were retrospective observational. Only seven publications dealt with outpatient care, the rest all in hospitalized patients.

Available TreatmentsAt this time, remdesivir and convalescent plasma have been granted emergency use authorization in the U.S.A., solely for hospitalized patients. There is also support for glucocorticoid treatment of the COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome. No treatments or prophylaxis are offered for outpatients.

CONCLUSIONCOVID-19 is propagated primarily by infected ambulatory individuals. There have been no options brought forward for prevention and non-hospital treatment with only a few randomized, controlled outpatient studies expected to yield results in time to impact on the continuing pandemic by the end of 2020. It will be necessary for public health authorities to make hard decisions, with limited data, to prevent the continued spread of the disease. The choices will be hardest when dealing with possible early release of safe and effective vaccines which would, of course, be of greatest benefit to the Worlds population.",23/01/2021,10.1101/2020.05.27.20115238,Marc Rendell,The Rose Salter Medical Research Foundation,medrxiv,0,0,,

MethodsWe screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020.

ResultsUp to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n = 43, 63%), patients relatives (n = 16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n = 5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n = 46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n = 5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515).

ConclusionThe investigated prophylaxis strategies cover both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and study numerous immune enhancers and antivirals, although most research efforts are focused on (hydroxy)chloroquine.",03/06/2020,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117937,Nathan Peiffer-Smadja,"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau",medrxiv,0,0,,
38,9291,Serological Assays Estimate Highly Variable SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Activity in Recovered COVID19 Patients,"The development of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against SARS-CoV-2, following infection or vaccination, is likely to be critical for the development of sufficient population immunity to drive cessation of the COVID19 pandemic. A large number of serologic tests, platforms and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasmas for therapeutic trials, and to guide policies about reopening. However, tests have substantial variability in sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of nAb is unknown. We collected 370 unique donors enrolled in the New York Blood Center Convalescent Plasma Program between April and May of 2020. We measured levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house ELISA assays and correlated serological measurements with nAb activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection. Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have varying degrees of accuracy in predicting nAb activity. We found the Ortho Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Ig and IgG high throughput serological assays (HTSAs), as well as the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, quantify levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with nAb assays and are consistent with gold-standard ELISA assay results. These findings provide immediate clinical relevance to serology results that can be equated to nAb activity and could serve as a valuable  roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.",09/09/2020,10.1101/2020.06.08.20124792,Larry L Luchsinger,New York Blood Center,medrxiv,0,0,,

HCWs who had voluntarily taken hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prior to exposure were considered one cohort while those who had not were considered to be another. All participants with a verifiable contact history were tested for COVID-19 by rtPCR. The two cohorts were comparable in terms of age, gender, comorbidities and exposure. The primary outcome was incidence rates of rtPCR positive COVID-19 infection amongst HCQ users and non users.

Results106 healthcare workers were examined in this cohort study of whom 54 were HCQ users and rest were not. The comparative analysis of incidence of infection between the two groups demonstrated that voluntary HCQ usage was associated with lesser likelihood of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it, X2=14.59, p<0.001. None of the HCQ users noted any serious adverse effects.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that voluntary HCQ consumption as pre-exposure prophylaxis by HCWs is associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2. These promising findings therefore highlight the need to examine this association in greater detail among a larger sample using Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT).",01/10/2020,10.1101/2020.06.09.20116806,Anita Nandi,Medical College Kolkata,medrxiv,0,0,,
40,9725,Global research trend in the treatment of the new Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) : bibliometric analysis.,"The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused worldwide concern and has become a major medical problem. Vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of this outbreak. This study aims to used bibliometric methods to identify research trends in the domain of therapeutics and vaccines to cure patients with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.

The Web of Science Core Collection database was retrieved for articles on therapeutic approaches to coronavirus disease management published between January 1, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Identified and analyzed the data included title, corresponding author, language, publication time, publication type, research focus.

A total of 1569 articles on coronavirus therapeutic means from 84 countries were published in 620 journals. We note the remarkable progressive increase in the number of publications related to research on therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. The United States provided the largest number of articles (405), followed by China (364). Journal of Medical Virology published most of them (n = 40). 1005 (64.05%) were articles, 286 (18.23%) were letters, 230 (14.66%) were reviews. The terms ""COVID- 19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""Coronavirus"" or ""hydroxychloroquine"" or ""chloroquine"" or ""2019-nCOV"" or ""ACE2"" or ""treatment"" or ""remdesivir"" or ""pneumonia"" were most frequently used, as shown in the density visualization map. A network analysis based on keyword co-occurrence revealed five distinct types of studies: clinical, biological, epidemiological, pandemic management, and therapeutics (vaccines and treatments).

COVID-19 is a major disease that has had an impact on international public health at the global level. Several avenues for treatment and vaccines have been explored. Most of them focus on older drugs used to treat other diseases that have been effective for other types of coronaviruses. There is a discrepancy in the results obtained from the studies of the drugs included in this study. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate older drugs and develop new treatment options.",14/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.13.20122762,Maxime Descartes Mbogning Fonkou,Aix Marseille Universite,medrxiv,0,0,,
41,9863,"Explore the Possible Impact of BCG Vaccination Policy on the Morbidity, Mortality, and Recovery Rates due to COVID-19 Infection.","BACKGROUNDThe Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world. Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity/mortality/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection.

METHODSData of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates.

RESULTSAmong those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively.

CONCLUSIONSThat data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery. BCG vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease-specific vaccine is developed, but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials.",18/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.14.20131268,Yue-Cune Chang,Tamkang University,medrxiv,0,0,,
42,9975,A longitudinal study of immune cells in severe COVID-19 patients.,"Little is known about the time-dependent immune responses in severe COVID-19. Data of 15 consecutive patients were sequentially recorded from intensive care unit admission. Lymphocyte subsets and total monocyte and subsets counts were monitored as well as the expression of HLA-DR. For 5 patients, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was assessed against Spike and Nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Non-specific inflammation markers were increased in all patients. Median monocyte HLA-DR expression was below the 8,000 AB/C threshold defining acquired immunodepression. A ""V"" trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11-14 after symptoms onset. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes. Polyfunctional SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 T-cells were present and functional, whereas virus-specific CD8 T-cells were less frequent and not efficient. We report a temporal variation of both innate and adaptive immunity in severe COVID-19 patients, helpful in guiding therapeutic decisions (e.g. anti-inflammatory vs. immunostimulatory ones). We describe a defect in virus-specific CD8 T-cells, a potential biomarker of clinical severity. These combined data also provide helpful knowledge for vaccine design.

43,10008,Efficacy and Safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundSince the emergence of COVID-19, the world has been desperate to find effective therapeutics and vaccinations to treat hundreds of thousands of affected patients and to suppress the spread of this global pandemic. Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/RTV) is an HIV antiviral combination that has been considered for treatment of this disease.

Aim of the studyThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients in the extant published research. A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA statement. Published English and non-English articles written since December 1, 2019 were selected for review from 8 electronic databases.

Readily accessible full articles (cohort studies and clinical trials) which specifically mentioned lopinavir/ritonavir and patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or COVOID-19 of any age were included. Three researchers separately evaluated the bias in the reported articles. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objective of evaluation of the safety and efficacy of LPV/RTV alone or in combination with other drugs with regard to time to becoming PCR negative, time to body temperature normalization and cough relief, radiological progression, and safety. Review Manager (RevMan) was used to conduct all statistical analyses and generate the forest plots. Meta-analyses were performed using the Mantel Hazel method or the inverse variance method for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively.

ResultsNon-duplicate articles (n=76) were evaluated for possible inclusion. A consensus was reached to select 29 articles for full-text screening, only 11 articles comprised 1,192 patients were included in this study, and six of which were included for meta-analysis.

In terms of virological cure (PCR negative), three studies reported less time in days to achieve a virological cure for LPV/RTV arm relative to no antiviral therapy (conventional) (mean difference = -0.81 day; 95% CI, -4.44 to 2.81; P = 0.007, I2 = 80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (P = 0.66). When comparing LPV/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm, but not statically significant (mean difference = 0.95 day; 95% CI, -1.11 to 3.01; P = 0.09, I2 = 58%).

In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief (clinical cure), two studies reported on time to temperature normalization with no significant effect of LPV/RTV (n = 93) versus umifenovir (n = 71) arm), (OR = 0.87 day; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.78; (P = 0.70), I2 = 0%), or alleviation of cough duration (p = 0.69).

In terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia/lung damage, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in no significant decrease in the radiological progression (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.54; P = 0.59, I2 = 81%), In terms of safety, a greater number of adverse events were reported for lopinavir/ritonavir (n=45) relative to the umifenovir arm (n=14) and conventional treatments (n=10), P = 0.004, 0,0007, respectively

ConclusionsThe small number of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study did not reveal any statistically significant advantage in efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients, over conventional or other antiviral treatments. This result might not reflect the actual evidence.",19/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.16.20133298,Mansour Tobaiqy,"Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",medrxiv,0,0,,
44,10247,Clinical predictors of donor antibody titer and correlation with recipient antibody response in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma clinical trial,"BackgroundConvalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on the transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial.

MethodsMultivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19.

FindingsMean symptom duration of plasma donors was 11.9{+/-}5.9 days and 7.8% (8/103) had been hospitalized. Antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:3,892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1:3,289 (anti-spike). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titer were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever, and absence of myalgia (all p<0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (p=0.03) but not anti-spike antibody titer (p=0.11). In pairwise comparison among ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD titer than O negative donors (p=0.048) and higher anti-spike titer than O negative (p=0.015) or O positive (p=0.037) donors. Eight of the ten recipients were discharged, one remains on ECMO and one died on ECMO. No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. After excluding two ECMO patients and adjusting for donor antibody titer, recipient anti-RBD antibody titer increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (p=0.01) and anti-spike antibody titer by 40.3% (p=0.02).

InterpretationAdvanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titer to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titer, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion among COVID-19 patients is needed to determine the clinical efficacy of this therapy.

45,10395,"Current infection control behaviour patterns in the UK, and how they can be improved by 'Germ Defence', an online behavioural intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the home.","BackgroundGerm Defence (https://germdefence.org/) is a freely available website providing behavioural advice for infection control within households, using behaviour change techniques. This observational study reports current infection control behaviours in the home in UK and international users of the website, and examine how they might be improved to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Method28,285 users sought advice from four website pathways (to protect themselves generally, to protect others if the user was showing symptoms, to protect themselves if household members were showing symptoms, and to protect a household member who is at high risk) and completed outcome measures of current infection control behaviours within the home (self-isolation, social distancing, putting shopping/packages aside, wearing face-covering, cleaning and disinfecting, handwashing), and intentions to change these behaviours.

ResultsCurrent user behaviours mean scores varied across all infection control measures but were between  sometimes and  quite often, except handwashing ( very often). Behaviours were similar regardless of the website pathway used. After using Germ Defence, users recorded intentions to improve infection control behaviour across all website pathways and for all behaviours.

ConclusionsSelf-reported infection control behaviours other than handwashing are lower than is optimal for infection prevention, although reported handwashing is much higher. The advice using behaviour change techniques in Germ Defence led to intentions to improve these behaviours. This has been shown previously to reduce the incidence, severity and transmission of infections. These findings suggest that promoting Germ Defence within national and local public health guidance could reduce COVID-19 transmission.

46,10321,BCG vaccination in infancy does not protect against COVID-19. Evidence from a natural experiment in Sweden.,"BackgroundThe Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2%, thus allowing us to estimate the BCGs effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons.

MethodsNumbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial.

ResultsThe odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0{middle dot}9997 (CI95: [0{middle dot}8002-1{middle dot}1992]) and 1{middle dot}1931 (CI95: [0{middle dot}7558-1{middle dot}6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24%

ConclusionsWhile the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.",23/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.22.20137802,Clement De Chaisemartin,UC Santa Barbara,medrxiv,0,0,,
47,10470,Phylogenomics and phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 retrieved genomes from India,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is one of the biggest outbreaks after the Spanish flu of 1918. Understanding the epidemiology of viral outbreaks is the first step towards vaccine development programs. This is the first phylodynamics study attempted on of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India to infer its current evolution in the context of an ongoing pandemic. Out of 286 retrieved SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes from India, 138 haplotypes were generated and analyzed. Median-joining network was built to investigate the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in India. The BDSIR package of BEAST2 was used to calculate the reproduction number (R0) and the infectious rate of the virus. Past and current population trend was investigated using the stamp date method in coalescent Bayesian skyline plot, implemented in BEAST2 and by exponential growth prior in BEAST 1.10.4. Median-joining network reveals two distinct ancestral clusters A and B showing genetic affinities with Wuhan outbreak sample. The network also illustrates the autochthonous development of isolates in a few instances. High basic reproduction number of SARS-nCoV-2 in India points towards the phase of active community transmission. The Bayesian skyline plot revel exponential rise in the effective population size (Ne) of Indian isolates from the first week of January to the first week of April 2020. More genome sequencing and analyses of the virus will be required in coming days to monitor COVID19 after the upliftment of lock down in India.",26/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.23.20138222,Mumtaz Baig,"Department of Zoology, Laboratory of Molecular and Conservation Genetics, Govt.

48,10344,HAS COUNTRYWIDE LOCKDOWN WORKED AS A FEASIBLE MEASURE IN BENDING THE COVID-19 CURVE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?,"In the absence of any effective vaccine and clinically proven treatment, experts thought that strict lockdown measures could be an effective way to slow down the spread of novel coronavirus. Despite the strict lockdown measures in several developing countries, the number of newly infected cases is getting unbridled as time progresses. This anomaly ignites questions about the effectiveness of the prolonged strict confinement measures. In light of the above view, with an aim to find the answer to this question, trends of four epidemiological parameters: growth factor of daily reported COVID-19 cases, daily incidence proportion, daily cumulative index and effective reproduction number in five developing countries named Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Pakistan and South Africa have been analysed meticulously considering the different phases of their national lockdowns. Any compelling evidence has not been found in favor of countrywide lockdown effectiveness in the above-mentioned countries. Numerical results illustrate that stringent nationwide lockdown measures have failed bringing the epidemic threshold (Re) of COVID-19 under unity. In addition, citizens of the aforementioned countries have been struggling with catastrophic socio-economic consequences due to prolonged confinement measures. Our study suggests that a new policy should be proposed for developing countries to battle against future disease outbreaks ensuring a perfect balance between saving lives and confirming livelihoods.",24/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.23.20138685,Khondoker Nazmoon Nabi,Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology,medrxiv,0,0,,
49,10544,A Metapopulation Network Model for the Spreading of SARS-CoV-2: Case Study for Ireland,"We present preliminary results on an all-Ireland network modelling approach to simulate the spreading the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly known as the coronavirus. In the model, nodes correspond to locations or communities that are connected by links indicating travel and commuting between different locations. While this proposed modelling framework can be applied on all levels of spatial granularity and different countries, we consider Ireland as a case study. The network comprises 3440 electoral divisions (EDs) of the Republic of Ireland and 890 superoutput areas (SOAs) for Northern Ireland, which corresponds to local administrative units below the NUTS 3 regions. The local dynamics within each node follows a phenomenological SIRX compartmental model including classes of Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered and Quarantined (X) inspired from Science 368, 742 (2020). For better comparison to empirical data, we extended that model by a class of Deaths. We consider various scenarios including the 5-phase roadmap for Ireland. In addition, as proof of concept, we investigate the effect of dynamic interventions that aim to keep the number of infected below a given threshold. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting containment measures on a national scale, which could also be implemented at a regional (county) or local (ED/SOA) level. We find that - in principle - dynamic interventions are capable to limit the impact of future waves of outbreaks, but on the downside, in the absence of a vaccine, such a strategy can last several years until herd immunity is reached.",16/01/2021,10.1101/2020.06.26.20140590,Philipp Hoevel,"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork",medrxiv,0,0,,
50,10570,Cost Benefit Analysis of Limited Reopening Relative to a Herd Immunity Strategy or Shelter in Place for SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,"BackgroundFierce debate about the health and financial tradeoffs presented by different COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies highlights the need for rigorous quantitative evaluation of policy options.

ObjectiveTo quantify the economic value of the costs and benefits of a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to alternative COVID-19 response strategies in the United States.

DesignWe estimate the number and value of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from mortality averted, with a value of $125,000 per QALY, and compare these benefits to the associated costs in terms of plausible effects on US GDP under a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to a policy of full reopening toward herd immunity. Using the same QALY value assumptions, we further evaluate cost-effectiveness of a return to Shelter-in-Place relative to a policy of limited reopening.

SettingUnited States

MeasurementsQALY and cost as percent of GDP of limited reopening with continued social distancing relative to a strategy of full reopening aimed at achieving herd immunity; a limited reopening ""budget"" measured in the number of months before this strategy fails to demonstrate cost-effectiveness relative to a full reopening; a shelter-in-place ""threshold"" measured in the number of lives saved at which a month of sheltering in place demonstrates cost effectiveness relative to the limited reopening strategy.

ResultsQALY benefits from mortality averted by continued social distancing and limited reopening relative to a policy of full reopening exceed projected GDP costs if an effective vaccine or therapeutic can be developed within 11.1 months from late May 2020. White House vaccine projections fall within this date, supporting a partial reopening strategy. One month of shelter-in-place restrictions provides QALY benefits from averted mortality that exceed the associated GDP costs relative to limited reopening if the restrictions prevent at least 154,586 additional COVID-19 deaths over the course of the pandemic. Current models of disease progression suggest that limited reopening will not cause this many additional deaths, again supporting a limited reopening strategy.

LimitationLimited horizon of COVID-19 mortality projections; infection fatality ratio stable across strategies, ignoring both the potential for ICU overload to increase mortality and the deployment of partially effective therapeutics to decrease mortality; effect on GDP modeled as constant within a given phase of the pandemic; accounts for age and sex distribution of QALYs, but not effect of comorbidities; only considers impact from QALY lost due to mortality and from changes in GDP, excluding numerous other considerations, such as non-fatal COVID-19 morbidity, reduced quality of life caused by prolonged social distancing, or educational regression associated with prolonged school closures and restrictions.

ConclusionsA limited reopening to achieve partial mitigation of COVID-19 is cost effective relative to a full reopening if an effective therapeutic or vaccine can be deployed within 11.1 months of late May 2020. One additional month of shelter-in-place restrictions should only be imposed if it saves at least 154,586 lives per month before the development of an effective therapeutic or vaccine relative to limited reopening.

A  new/better normal is emerging that is trying to push this time period for drug development and vaccine within a year and earlier than that from typical 8 to 10 years for drugs and 10 to 15 years for vaccine. This is happening due to multiple factors: strong policy push by different government that includes dedicated investment, speeding up regulation process, multiple agencies involvement, and multilateral bodies led by WHO trying to create a global platform, huge grants from private funding bodies, strategic linkages across the whole research and innovation value chain between firms, academic, research organisations and start-ups.

The paper maps the research papers and ongoing clinical trials to provide an informed view of the current status of the research and drug development activity as seen through the lens of research papers and clinical trials.

In the absence of any vaccine, various mitigation measures were used. In the past, the effect of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus was studied for a very early phase of the data with mixed results. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on the maximum temperature and relative humidity of a place using Indian states as test cases for SIR, SIRD, and SEIR models. We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and relative humidity. Most of the states showed a correlation with the negative slope between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and the relative humidity. It indicates that the effective reproduction number goes down as maximum temperature or relative humidity rise. But, the regression coefficient R2 was low for these correlations which means that the correlation is not strong.",06/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.05.20146324,Sabyasachi Pal,Midnapore City College,medrxiv,0,0,,
54,11502,'Trained immunity' from  Mycobacterium spp. exposure or BCG vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes,"Protective variables for COVID-19 are unknown.  Trained immunity of the populace as a result of BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of  trained immunity or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of controls for underlying  trained immunity and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.",02/09/2020,10.1101/2020.07.11.20151308,Samer Singh,Banaras Hindu University Institute of Medical Sciences,medrxiv,0,0,,

We thus examined whether the administration of QFPDT at a dose lower than recommended for therapeutic use alters hematological and/or immunological measures in healthy individuals. We found that QFPDT elevates the plasma levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-18, TNF-, and IL-8, which are key mediators of acute inflammatory responses to ssRNA viruses. No apparent adverse effects were observed during the trial. Our finding suggests that the pharmacological action of QFPDT is associated with the upregulation of a subset of proinflammatory cytokines despite its clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients. We should therefore be careful in its prophylactic use in uninfected individuals until we have a better understanding of the immunopharmacological action of QFPDT through further clinical studies with larger cohorts.",20/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.13.20146175,Tsutomu Nakamura,"Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo",medrxiv,0,0,,
56,11578,"Interest in COVID-19 vaccine trials participation among young adults in China: Willingness, reasons for hesitancy, and demographic and psychosocial determinants","BackgroundWith the demand for rapid COVID-19 vaccine development and evaluation, this paper aimed to describe the prevalence and correlates of willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials among university students in China.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate.

ResultsThe majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial willingness.

ConclusionsHigh standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.",14/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.13.20152678,Danhua Lin,Beijing Normal University,medrxiv,0,0,,
57,11759,Longitudinal dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF.

ConclusionsThese data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.",17/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159,Ai-Long Huang,Chongqing Medical University,medrxiv,0,0,,
58,11787,Reconciling model predictions with low reported cases of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights from Madagascar,"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally, and there has been a particular concern for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where models suggest that the majority of the population will become infected. Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers high burdens of other infectious diseases: ecology, socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems. However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading explanations, each with very different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case detection, (2) differences in COVID-19 epidemiology (e.g. low R0), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases to date have led some SSA governments to relax these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the current incidence of COVID-19 cases can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of an impending health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar until early 2021, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.

ResumeLa pandemie de COVID-19 a eu des consequences nefastes partout dans le monde, et il y a une preoccupation particuliere pour lAfrique subsaharienne (ASS), ou des modeles suggerent que la majorite de la population sera infectee. Il est craint que le continent supportera un fardeau plus elevee de COVID-19 pour les memes raisons quil souffre davantage dautres maladies infectieuses: ecologie, conditions socio-economiques, manque dinfrastructures deau et dassainissement, et faiblesse des systemes de sante. Cependant, jusqua present, lASS a rapporte une incidence et une mortalite bien inferieure a celle des previsions des modeles pour cette region, ainsi quau nombre observe dans dautres regions du monde. Il y a trois explications principales pour ce phenomene, chacune ayant des implications tres differentes pour le fardeau epidemique final: (1) detection faible des cas, (2) differences dans lepidemiologie COVID-19 (par exemple faible R0), et (3) interventions et politiques mises en place. Le faible nombre de cas a ce jour a conduit certains gouvernements dASS a assouplir ces interventions. Cela entrainera-t-il une resurgence de cas? Pour comprendre comment interpreter le fait que les cas COVID-19 rapportes sont plus faibles que prevu a Madagascar, nous utilisons un modele de transmission structure par groupe dage pour explorer chacune de ces explications et predire limpact epidemique qui leur est associe. Nous montrons que lincidence actuelle des cas de COVID-19 peut sexpliquer par leffet cumule de lintroduction tardive des premiers cas importes, la mise en uvre rapide dinterventions non pharmaceutiques (INP) et de faibles taux de detection des cas. Cette analyse renforce le fait que Madagascar, ainsi que dautres pays dAfrique subsaharienne, reste a risque dune crise sanitaire imminente. Si les INP restent appliques, jusqua 50 000 vies pourraient etre sauvees. Meme avec des INP, tant quil ny aura pas des vaccins ni des nouvelles therapies efficaces, COVID-19 pourrait infecter jusqua 30% de la population, ce qui constituerait la plus grande menace pour la sante publique a Madagascar jusquau debut de 2021, dou limportance de la realisation des essais cliniques et de lamelioration continuelle de lacces aux soins.

Summary BoxO_LIThe lower-than-expected number of reported cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar can be explained by a combination of the relatively late introduction of the disease, low detection rates, and low transmission rates due to the early and effective implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduced contact rates.

60,12038,Neutralizing and binding antibody kinetics of COVID-19 patients during hospital and convalescent phases,"Knowledge of the host immune response after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for informing directions of vaccination and epidemiological control strategies against COVID-19. In this study, thirty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled with 244 serial blood specimens (38.1% after hospital discharge) collected to explore the chronological evolution of neutralizing (NAb), total (TAb), IgM, IgG and IgA antibody in parallel. IgG titers reached a peak later (approximately 35 days postonset) than those of Nab, Ab, IgM and IgA (20[~]25 days postonset). After peaking, IgM levels declined with an estimated average half-life of 10.36 days, which was more rapid than those of IgA (51.25 days) and IgG (177.39 days). Based on these half-life data, we estimate that the median times for IgM, IgA and IgG to become seronegative are 4.59 (IQR 4.12-5.03), 7.78 (IQR 6.71-9.16) and 42.72 (IQR 33.75-47.96) months post disease onset. The relative contribution of IgM to NAb was higher than that of IgG (standardized {beta} regression coefficient: 0.53 vs 0.48), so the rapid decline in NAb may be attributed to the rapid decay of IgM in acute phase. However, the relative contribution of IgG to NAb increased and that of IgM further decreased after 6 weeks postonset. Its assumed that the decline rate of NAb might slow down to the same level as that of IgG over time. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust neutralizing and binding antibody responses in patients and that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 acquired by infection may persist for a relatively long time.",21/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.18.20156810,Sheng-Xiang Ge,"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai",medrxiv,0,0,,
61,12385,"Viral RNA level, serum antibody responses, and transmission risk in discharged COVID-19 patients with recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results: a population-based observational cohort study","SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSManaging discharged COVID-19 (DC) patients with recurrent positive (RP) SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results is challenging. We aimed to comprehensively characterize the viral RNA level and serum antibody responses in RP-DC patients and evaluate their viral transmission risk.

MethodsA population-based observational cohort study was performed on 479 DC patients discharged from February 1 to May 5, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. We conducted RT-qPCR, antibody assays, neutralisation assays, virus isolation, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and epidemiological investigation of close contacts.

FindingsOf 479 DC patients, the 93 (19%) RP individuals, including 36 with multiple RP results, were characterised by young age (median age: 34 years, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-38 years). The median discharge-to-RP length was 8 days (95% CI: 7-14 days; maximum: 90 days). After readmission, RP-DC patients exhibited mild (28%) or absent (72%) symptoms, with no disease progression. The viral RNA level in RP-DC patients ranged from 1{middle dot}9-5{middle dot}7 log10 copies/mL (median: 3{middle dot}2, 95% CI: 3{middle dot}1-3{middle dot}5). At RP detection, the IgM, IgG, IgA, total antibody, and neutralising antibody (NAb) seropositivity rates in RP-DC patients were 38% (18/48), 98% (47/48), 63% (30/48), 100% (48/48), and 91% (39/43), respectively. Regarding antibody levels, there was no significant difference between RP-DC and non-RP-DC patients. The antibody level remained constant in RP-DC patients pre- and post-RP detection. Virus isolation of nine representative specimens returned negative results. WGS of six specimens yielded only genomic fragments. No clinical symptoms were exhibited by 96 close contacts of 23 RP-DC patients; their viral RNA (96/96) and antibody (20/20) test results were negative. After full recovery, 60% of patients (n=162, 78 no longer RP RP-DC and 84 non-RP-DC) had NAb titres of [&ge;]1:32.

InterpretationRP may occur in DC patients following intermittent and non-stable excretion of low viral RNA levels. RP-DC patients pose a low risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. An NAb titre of [&ge;] 1:32 may provide a reference indicator for evaluating humoral responses in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.

62,12227,D614G Spike Mutation Increases SARS CoV-2 Susceptibility to Neutralization.,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the COVID-19 pandemic that appears to confer on the virus greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form of the virus. Certain of the current vaccines entering phase 3 trials are based on the original D614 form of Spike with the goal of eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies. To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against the receptor binding domain and by convalescent sera from people known to be infected with either the D614 or G614 form of the virus. These results indicate that a gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies, and that the mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development.",12/09/2020,10.1101/2020.07.22.20159905,Drew Weissman,University of Pennsylvania,medrxiv,0,0,,
63,12478,A Retrospective Study on Efficacy and Safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati for Covid-19 Asymptomatic Patients,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been declared global emergency with immediate safety, preventative and curative measures to control the spread of virus. Confirmed cases are treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19. Ayurveda has been recommended by preventative and clinical management guidelines in India and several clinical trials are ongoing. But there is no study to assess impact of Ayurveda on Covid-19.

MethodsObjective of present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in Covid-19 confirmed asymptomatic to mild symptomatic patients who had received Ayurveda and compare with control (who has not received Ayurveda or any support therapy). Patients having Ayurveda intervention (Guduchi Ghan Vati-extract of Tinospora cordifolia) were included from Jodhpur Covid Care Centre and non-recipients were taken from Jaipur Covid Care Centre between May 15 to June 15, 2020. Total 91 patients, who were asymptomatic at the time of hospital admission and between 18 -75 years of age, were included in the study to analyse retrospectively.

ResultsIn control group, 11.7% developed mild symptoms after average 1.8 days and none in Ayurveda group reported any symptoms. Significant difference was reported between the group of patients taking Guduchi Ghan Vati (n=40) and patients in standard care (n=51) in terms of virologic clearance at day-7 (97.5% vs 15.6% respectively; p=0.000), at day 14 (100% vs 82.3%) days to stay in hospital (6.4 vs 12.8 respectively; p< 0.0001).

ConclusionResults of the study suggest that Guduchi Ghan Vati, a common and widely used Ayurveda preparation, could benefit treating asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Larger, randomised controlled Trials are required to confirm the findings.

64,12634,Impact of reduction of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 on epidemic dynamics in four early-seeded metropolitan regions,"The coronavirus pandemic is wreaking public health, social, and economic havoc across the globe, and to date a variety of strategies have been implemented to attempt to control the spread of disease [1, 2]. A critical unknown for policy planning is the number of people who have been infected and are no longer susceptible [3]. Tests for active SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibody presence can provide an indication, but both are prone to selection bias, under-representative population sampling and insufficient reliability [4, 5]. Here, we present an alternative to determine residual susceptibilities based on the analysis of observed population-wide disease dynamics data. For four highly-affected countries, we directly compared the dynamics in the largest metropolitan regions with the rest of the countries. We show that substantial susceptibility reductions are measurable in the metropolitan regions, which all continued in a phase of exponential growth of case numbers for a relatively longer time before public health interventions were introduced. Compared to these interventions, the reduction in metropolitan region susceptibility had a substantial role in the post-growth decline in infection rates. Reduced population susceptibility has far reaching consequences on future policy responses and disease forecasts including vaccine trial planning and, in the case of a second epidemic wave, higher population-normalised mortality rates for non-metropolitan regions.",19/09/2020,10.1101/2020.07.28.20163154,Peter Kruger,University of Sussex,medrxiv,0,0,,
66,12787,Safety and effectiveness of dose-sparing strategies for seasonal influenza vaccine: a rapid scoping review of fractional dosing of the intramuscular influenza vaccine,"BackgroundThe objective of this rapid scoping review was to identify potentially safe and effective dose-sparing strategies for intramuscular administration of seasonal influenza vaccines in healthy individuals of all ages.

MethodsComprehensive literature searches were developed and executed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library, and grey literature was searched via international clinical trial registries for relevant studies published in English in the last 20 years. References of relevant systematic reviews and included studies were also scanned. Title/abstract and full-text screening were carried out by pairs of reviewers independently and data charting conducted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Results were presented narratively.

ResultsA total of 13 studies with 10,351 participants were included in the review and all studies were randomized control trials conducted between 2006 and 2019. The most common interventions were the trivalent influenza vaccine (n=10), followed by quadrivalent influenza vaccine (n=4). Nine studies included infants/toddlers 6-36 months old and one of these studies also included children and adolescents. In these nine studies, no clinical effectiveness outcomes were reported and no difference was found in local and systemic reactogenicity between dosing strategies. Of the four adult studies ([&ge;] 18 years), the two studies that reported on effectiveness outcomes found similar results between the half-dose and full-dose vaccination groups and all four studies reported no differences in safety outcomes between groups.

ConclusionThe current evidence for the administration of intramuscular influenza vaccines suggests there is no significant difference in safety and clinical effectiveness with the use of low-dose compared to full-dose vaccines, which is promising given the predicted resource constraints in the upcoming influenza season due to the 2019 novel coronavirus. Due to the low number of studies in adults and the lack of studies assessing confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness, there remains a need for further evaluation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSPURPOSEC_ST_ABSThe Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) submitted a query regarding the safety and effectiveness of fractional dosing of seasonal influenza vaccines through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN). They requested that the DSEN Methods and Application Group in Indirect Comparisons (MAGIC) conduct a rapid review on this topic with an approximate 6-week timeline.

The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify potentially safe and effective dose-sparing strategies for administration of seasonal influenza vaccines in healthy individuals of all ages that have been evaluated in human trials. In order to limit the scope of the work and ensure the rapid timeline could be met, this review focused only on intramuscular vaccine formulations, thus the research question was as follows:

67,12790,"Evaluation of Convalescent Plasma versus Standard of Care for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalazed Patients: study protocol for a phase 2 randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter trial","BackgroundCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods/DesignThe ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The protocol has been prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to categories 5, 6 or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment.

DiscussionThis clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease.

69,13156,Public perceptions and preventive behaviours during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparative study between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom,"BackgroundIn the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of COVID-19 relies on population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions, which is driven by their risk perception, anxiety level and knowledge. There may also be regional discrepancies in these drivers due to different historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. As such, this study compared psycho-behavioral responses in two regions during the early phase of the pandemic.

MethodsComparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of each respective epidemic. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including interaction terms to quantify regional differences, were used to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing measures.

ResultsData of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity differed by region (HK: 97.5%; UK: 20.7%). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally/borderline anxious (HK:64.8%; UK:45.9%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.4-93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by region. In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as ""high"" were more likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as ""easy"" were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary by region.

DiscussionThese results suggest that health officials should ascertain and consider baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be done through suitable media channels - and trust should be maintained - while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.",07/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.06.20169409,Kin On Kwok,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,medrxiv,0,0,,
70,13243,Considering indirect benefits is critical when evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates,"Significant progress has already been made in development and testing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and Phase III clinical trials have begun for 6 novel vaccine candidates to date. These Phase III trials seek to demonstrate direct benefits of a vaccine on vaccine recipients. However, vaccination is also known to bring about indirect benefits to a population through the reduction of virus circulation. The indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can play a key role in reducing case counts and COVID-19 deaths. To illustrate this point, we show through simulation that a vaccine with strong indirect effects has the potential to reduce SARS-CoV-2 circulation and COVID-19 deaths to a greater extent than an alternative vaccine with stronger direct effects but weaker indirect effects. Protection via indirect effects may be of particular importance in the context of this virus, because elderly individuals are at an elevated risk of death but are also less likely to be directly protected by vaccination due to immune senescence. We therefore encourage ongoing data collection and model development aimed at evaluating the indirect effects of forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",11/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.07.20170456,Molly E.

71,13470,Local protection bubbles: an interpretation of the decrease in the velocity of coronavirus's spread in the city of Sao Paulo,"After four months of dealing with the pandemic, the city of Sao Paulo entered a phase of relaxed social-distancing measures in July 2020, and saw its social isolation rate fall at the same time as the number of cases, deaths, and hospital bed occupation declined. We use a calibrated multi-agent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the citys sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the viruss spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the viruss spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the populations transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.",14/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.11.20173039,Jose Paulo Guedes Pinto,Federal University of ABC (UFABC),medrxiv,0,0,,
73,13894,Dynamic causal modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern Italy predicts possible scenarios for the second wave,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an intense debate about the factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak. Mitigating virus spread could benefit from reliable predictive models that inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection that underwrite ongoing social and healthcare strategies. Formally, the problem at hand is not unlike the one faced in neuroscience when modelling brain dynamics in terms of the activity of a neural network: the recent COVID-19 pandemic develops in epicenters (e.g. cities or regions) and diffuses through transmission channels (e.g., population fluxes). Indeed, the analytic framework known as ""Dynamic Causal Modeling"" (DCM) has recently been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the mechanisms and latent factors driving its evolution. The DCM approach rests on a time-series generative model that provides -- through Bayesian model inversion and inference -- estimates of the factors underlying the progression of the pandemic. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, which were the first areas in Europe to contend with the COVID-19 outbreak. We used official data on the number of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and performed tests. The model -- parameterized using data from the first months of the pandemic phase -- was able to accurately predict its subsequent evolution (including social mobility, as assessed through GPS monitoring, and seroprevalence, as assessed through serologic testing) and revealed the potential factors underlying regional heterogeneity. Importantly, the model predicts that a second wave could arise due to a loss of effective immunity after about 7 months. This second wave was predicted to be substantially worse if outbreaks are not promptly isolated and contained. In short, dynamic causal modelling appears to be a reliable tool to shape and predict the spread of the COVID-19, and to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently counteract its second wave, until effective vaccines become available.",23/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.20.20178798,Daniela Gandolfi,University of Modena and Reggio Emilia,medrxiv,0,0,,
74,13901,Poor knowledge of COVID-19 and unfavourable perception of the response to the pandemic by healthcare workers at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (West Region - Cameroon),"BackgroundThe World Health Organization has warned against a dramatic impact of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa unless adequate response strategies are implemented. Whatever the strategy, the role of health care workers is pivotal. We undertook this study to assess knowledge of COVID-19 and perception of the response to the pandemic among the staff of a regional hospital in charge of COVID-19 patients in West Cameroon.

MethodsWe used a convenience non probabilistic sampling method to carry out a survey with a self-administered questionnaire from April 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020 at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (BRH). All the staff was invited to participate. Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Epi-lnfo version 7.1.5.2 software.

ResultsResponse rate was 76.1% (464/610). Mean age (SD) and average work experience (SD) were 35.0 (8.9) and 8.4 (7.4) years respectively. Sex ratio (M/F) was 101/356. Nursing and midwifery staff (56.8%) and in-patients units (49.94%) were predominant. Knowledge on origin and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was poor but knowledge of clinical signs and the role of laboratory tests were good. 53.2% of respondents said all therapeutic regimens are only supportive and only a third of them trusted drugs recommended by health authorities. For 36.9% of respondents, herbal remedies can prevent/cure COVID-19. 70% of staffs felt they were not knowledgeable enough to handle COVID-19 cases. 85.6% of respondents thought the BRH had insufficient resources to adequately respond to COVID-19 and 55.6% were dissatisfied with its response to the pandemic (weaknesses: medicines/technologies (74.5%), service delivery (28.1%), human resource (10.9%)). 68% of staff felt insufficiently protected on duty and 76.5% reported that the pandemic significantly reduced non-COVID-19 services. 85.5% said they complied with preventive measures while in the community. For 44% of respondents Cameroonian regulations on COVID-19 corpses should be made more culture-sensitive. 51.2% of respondents were against vaccine trial in their community.

75,14099,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans: a systematic review,"IntroductionProgress in characterising the humoral immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapid but areas of uncertainty persist. This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020.

MethodsSystematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised.

Results150 papers were included. Most studies (75%) were observational in design, and included papers were generally of moderate quality based on hospitalised patients. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, and up to around 3 months from disease onset, although inconsistencies remain concerning clinical correlates. Development of neutralising antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is typical, although titres may be low. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross reactivity but limited cross neutralisation occurs with other HCoVs. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo is limited to small, short-term animal studies, which show promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase.

InterpretationPublished literature on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity with regard to methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Antibody dynamics have been evaluated thoroughly in the acute phase but longer follow up and a comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity is needed. The role of protective neutralising antibodies is emerging, with implications for therapeutics and vaccines. Large, cross-national cohort studies using appropriate statistical analysis and standardised serological assays and clinical classifications should be prioritised.",30/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.25.20178806,Danielle Eddy,Public Health England,medrxiv,0,0,,
76,14302,Systematic examination of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 versus influenza virus reveals distinct inflammatory profile,"There is a pressing need for an in-depth understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated T cell recall responses to fully glycosylated Spike trimer, recombinant N protein as well as to S, N, M and E peptide pools in the early convalescent phase. All subjects showed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses to at least one antigen. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were primarily of the central memory phenotype and exhibited a lower IFN-{gamma} to TNF- ratio compared to influenza-specific responses of the same donors, independent of disease severity. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were less multifunctional than influenza-specific T cells, particularly in severe cases, potentially suggesting exhaustion. High IL-10 production was noted in response to N protein, possibly contributing to immunosuppression, with potential implications for vaccine design. We observed granzyme B+/IFN-{gamma}g+ CD4+ and CD8+ proliferative responses to peptide pools in most individuals, with CD4+ responses predominating over CD8+ responses. Peripheral T follicular helper responses to S or N strongly correlated with serum neutralization assays as well as RBD-specific IgA. Overall, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are robust, however, CD4+ Th1 responses predominate over CD8+ responses and are more inflammatory with a weaker Tfh response than influenza-specific CD4+ responses, potentially contributing to COVID-19 disease.",01/09/2020,10.1101/2020.08.27.20183319,Tania H Watts,University of Toronto,medrxiv,0,0,,
77,14257,Data-driven Optimized Control of the COVID-19 Epidemics,"Optimizing the impact on the economy of control strategies aiming at containing the spread of COVID-19 is a critical challenge. We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with the implemented system of reopening  in phases. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields progressively stricter measures of social distancing. We finally compute the optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of factors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the period over which vaccines are administered to the population.",10/03/2021,10.1101/2020.08.27.20183574,Afroza Shirin,University of New Mexico,medrxiv,0,0,,

79,14676,Immunological characteristics govern the changing severity of COVID-19 during the transition to endemicity,"1As prospects for eradicating CoV-2 dwindle, we are faced with the question of how the severity of CoV-2 disease may change in the years ahead. Will CoV-2 continue to be a pathogenic scourge that, like smallpox or measles, can be tamed only by ongoing vaccination, or will it join the ranks of mild endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)? Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on HCoVs shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. We estimate the relevant parameters and incorporate them into a new epidemiological model framework which separates these different components of immunity. Our model recapitulates both the current severity of CoV-2 and the relatively benign nature of HCoVs; suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached, CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. The benign outcome at the endemic phase is contingent on the virus causing primary infections in children. We predict a very different outcome were a CoV like MERS (that causes severe disease in children) to become endemic. These results force us to re-evaluate control measures that rely on identifying and isolating symptomatic infections, and reconsider ideas regarding herd immunity and the use of immune individuals as shields to protect vulnerable groups.",05/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.03.20187856,Jennie S Lavine,Emory University,medrxiv,0,0,,
80,14866,Demographic Differences in US Adult Intentions to Receive a Potential Coronavirus Vaccine and Implications for Ongoing Study,"BackgroundThe coronavirus pandemics public health and economic impacts have led to much hope in the US regarding the prospect of a safe, effective vaccine to either prevent infection or minimize symptoms and reduce mortality risk. However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it.

Methods and findingsMultivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n = 1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.",09/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.07.20190058,Richard M.

81,15185,Characterization and Phase 1 Trial of a B Cell Activating Anti-CD73 Antibody for the Immunotherapy of COVID-19,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in over 800,000 deaths. Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. This approach may be useful for treating COVID-19 or as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.",15/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.10.20191486,Stephen B Willingham,Corvus Pharmaceuticals,medrxiv,0,0,,

None of the 11 clinical trials published in scientific journals on June 2020 reported sex-disaggregated results. Hence, lack of consideration upon registration does not seem to be corrected during trial execution and reporting.

84,15420,How the clinical research community responded to the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of the COVID-19 clinical studies in ClinicalTrials.gov,"ObjectiveThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, is a global pandemic. Rapidly in the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies. In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the gaps and issues that may cause difficulty in recruitment and the lack of population representativeness.

Materials and MethodsWe analyzed 2,034 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov. Leveraging natural language processing, descriptive analysis, association analysis, and clustering analysis, we characterized COVID-19 clinical studies by phase and design features. Particularly, we analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand: (1) whether they considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) if these studies excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies in older adults.

ResultsThe 5 most frequently tested drugs are Hydroxychloroquine (N=148), Azithromycin (N=46), Tocilizumab (N=29), Lopinavir (N=20), and Ritonavir (N=20). Most trials did not have an upper age limit and did not exclude patients with common chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes that are prevalent in older adults. However, known risk factors that may lead to severe illnesses have not been adequately considered by existing studies.

ConclusionsA careful examination of the registered COVID-19 clinical studies can identify the research gaps and inform future COVID-19 trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability.",15/12/2020,10.1101/2020.09.16.20195552,Zhe He,Florida State University,medrxiv,0,0,,
85,15435,Suppression of COVID-19 infection by isolation time control based on the SIR model and an analogy from nuclear fusion research,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been damaging our daily life after declaration of pandemic. Therefore, we have started studying on the characteristics of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to know about the truth of infectious disease and our future.

After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term (isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the ""helium ash particle loss term"" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation control time parameter q and have studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this proposed method.

To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density. We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3[~]8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer. We consider this isolation time control might be the only solution to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.",23/11/2020,10.1101/2020.09.18.20197723,Osamu Mitarai,Institute for Advanced Fusion & Physics Education,medrxiv,0,0,,
86,15632,Molecular Architecture of Early Dissemination and Massive Second Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in a Major Metropolitan Area,"We sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains causing two COVID-19 disease waves in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston, and an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotypes and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some regions of the spike protein - the primary target of global vaccine efforts - are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR30022. Our study is the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region. The findings will help us to understand the origin, composition, and trajectory of future infection waves, and the potential effect of the host immune response and therapeutic maneuvers on SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

IMPORTANCEThere is concern about second and subsequent waves of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus occurring in communities globally that had an initial disease wave. Metropolitan Houston, Texas, with a population of 7 million, is experiencing a massive second disease wave that began in late May 2020. To understand SARS-CoV-2 molecular population genomic architecture, evolution, and relationship between virus genotypes and patient features, we sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains from these two waves.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. This study aims to understand the perception of the public towards hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in August 2020 across the 36 states of Nigeria using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis.

89,15716,The potential health and economic value of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alongside physical distancing in the UK: transmission model-based future scenario analysis and economic evaluation,"BackgroundIn response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the UK adopted mandatory physical distancing measures in March 2020. Vaccines against the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may become available as early as late 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing scenarios in the UK.

MethodsWe used an age-structured dynamic-transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of immunisation programmes over ten years. Assuming vaccines are effective in 5-64 year olds, we compared vaccinating 90% of individuals in this age group to no vaccination. We assumed either vaccine effectiveness of 25% and 1-year protection and 90% re-vaccinated annually, or 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection and 10% re-vaccinated annually. Natural immunity was assumed to last 45 weeks in the base case. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing. We considered benefits from disease prevented in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs to the healthcare payer versus the national economy. We discounted at 3.5% annually and monetised health impact at {pound}20,000 per QALY to obtain the net monetary value, which we explored in sensitivity analyses.

FindingsWithout vaccination and physical distancing, we estimated 147.9 million COVID-19 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 48.5 million, 198.7 million) and 2.8 million (770,000, 4.2 million) deaths in the UK over ten years. Vaccination with 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection may stop community transmission entirely for several years, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic without highly effective vaccines. Introducing vaccination compared to no vaccination leads to economic gains (positive net monetary value) of {pound}0.37 billion to +{pound}1.33 billion across all physical distancing and vaccine effectiveness scenarios from the healthcare perspective, but net monetary values of physical distancing scenarios may be negative from societal perspective if the daily national economy losses are persistent and large.

InterpretationOur model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Given uncertainty around both characteristics of the eventually licensed vaccines and long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, our study provides early insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and medRxiv for economic evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with the search string (coronavirus OR COVID OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (vaccin* OR immunisation) AND ((economic evaluation) OR (cost effectiveness analysis)) AND 2020[dp] on September 21, 2020, with no language restrictions. We found one pre-print that valued health outcomes in monetary terms and explored the additional impact of vaccines in a cost-benefit analysis of physical distancing for the USA; no study focused on vaccines in a full economic evaluation.

Added value of this studyWith a growing number of vaccine candidates under development and having entered clinical trials, our study is to our knowledge the first to explore the health and economic value of introducing a national SARS-CoV-2 immunisation programme. A programme with high vaccine effectiveness and long-lasting protection may stop the community transmission entirely for a couple of years, but even a vaccine with 25% vaccine effectiveness is worthwhile to use; even at short-lived natural and vaccine-induced protections. After an initial lockdown, voluntary physical distancing as a sole strategy risks a large second epidemic peak, unless accompanied by highly effective immunisation. Compared to no vaccination, introducing vaccination leads to positive net monetary value across physical distancing scenarios from the healthcare perspective, subject to the long-run vaccine price and cost-effectiveness of other treatments (e.g. new drugs). The net monetary value of immunisation decreases if vaccine introduction is delayed, natural immunity is long or vaccine-induced protection is short. Intermittent physical distancing leads to negative net benefits from the perspective of the wider economy if the daily national income losses are persistent and large.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur model findings highlight the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Despite the many uncertainties, continued physical distancing may be needed to reduce community transmission until vaccines with sufficiently high vaccine effectiveness and long-lasting protection are available. Our study provides first broad health-economic insights rather than precise quantitative projections given the many uncertainties and unknown characteristics of the vaccine candidates and aspects of the long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, and the value of vaccines will ultimately depend on other socioeconomic and health-related policies and population behaviours.",25/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.24.20200857,Frank Sandmann,PHE/LSHTM,medrxiv,0,0,,
91,16098,"Quantifying the dynamics of COVID-19 burden and impact of interventions in Java, Indonesia","BackgroundAs in many countries, quantifying COVID-19 spread in Indonesia remains challenging due to testing limitations. In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island.

MethodsWe used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine roll-out.

ResultsC19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled-out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign.

ConclusionSyndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained.

92,16172,Evaluating the Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines,"A large number of studies are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines against novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Most Phase 3 trials have adopted virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease as the primary efficacy endpoint, although laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest. In addition, it is important to evaluate the effect of vaccination on disease severity. To provide a full picture of vaccine efficacy and make efficient use of available data, we propose using SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 as dual or triple primary endpoints. We demonstrate the advantages of this strategy through realistic simulation studies. Finally, we show how this approach can provide rigorous interim monitoring of the trials and efficient assessment of the durability of vaccine efficacy.

SummaryTo increase statistical power and meet vaccine success criteria, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines by using the dual or triple primary endpoints of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19.",10/12/2020,10.1101/2020.10.02.20205906,Dan-Yu Lin,"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",medrxiv,0,0,,
93,16177,Safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy used for the management of COVID 19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, which is highly contagious and a threat to human health, spreading across nearly 235 countries, affecting 33.8 million and causing 1.01 million fatalities as of 22 September 2020. Researchers have invested tremendous efforts to develop vaccines or effective drug therapy but have not yet been fruitful. Hence, we planned to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to supplement the readers with comprehensive data and credible information on the safety and efficacyof essential pharmacotherapy during the pharmacological management of COVID-19.

MethodsTheprotocol will be designed based on the updated PRISMA-P 2015 guidelines. An elaborate search of electronic databases such as PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, Medrxiv and other potential databases for articles published during January 2020 to 10 October 2020 is planned to be conducted. Following this,randomized control trials published in English language that assess the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy versusplacebo or standard of care or usual care will be evaluated for inclusion. The primary outcomes will include time to clinical recovery and the probability for the negative conversion of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes will quantifythe proportion of patients relieved of symptoms, the all-cause mortality, morbidity, detection of viral RNA, time needed to achieve a negative viral load, ordinal scale changes, ventilatorand oxygen requirements,length of hospital stayand the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events.RevMan V.5.3 computer software packages will be utilised to conduct an accurate statistical analysis of the study. Thebinary random-effects model will be used at a 95 % confidence interval to estimate the weighted effect size ofdichotomous data and continuous data studies. The results of statistical analysis will be considered statistically significant whena p-value <0.05 is attained.

ResultsSelected studies will be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy used during the management of the novel COVID-19.

ConclusionThis study will be a qualitative and quantitative pool of comprehensive evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy on COVID-19.

94,16202,An open-label prospective observational study of antiandrogen and non-antiandrogen early pharmacological approaches in females with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The Pre-AndroCoV Female Trial.,"BackgroundWhile COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.

Materials and methodsFemales with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression.

ResultsIn total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 {+/-} 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 {+/-} 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 {+/-} 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), headache (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), dry cough (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), myalgia (1.2 {+/-} 0.4), nauseas (1.3 {+/-} 0.5) and weakness (1.3 {+/-} 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication.

ConclusionsA sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.",06/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.05.20206870,Flavio A Cadegiani,Federal University of Sao Paulo,medrxiv,0,0,,
95,16412,A high-throughput microfluidic nano-immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or ultra-low volume dried blood samples,"Novel technologies are needed to facilitate large-scale detection and quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies in human blood samples. Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 {micro}L whole blood easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.",08/02/2021,10.1101/2020.10.07.20208280,Sebastian J.

96,16470,SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells correlate with neutralizing antibodies and increase during convalescence.,"T-cell immunity is likely to play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 by helping generate neutralizing antibodies. We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 21 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mount at least one CD4 T-cell response, and 48% of individuals mount detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh, defined as CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that M and N protein-specific pTfh may also assist in the development of neutralizing antibodies and that pTfh response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Author SummarySince December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most currently licensed vaccines are understood to protect against infection by inducing neutralizing antibodies. As such, ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials have focused on antibody neutralization as a primary immunologic endpoint. It is well established that T follicular helper cells are essential to the development of neutralizing antibodies and that a subset of these cells, peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh), can be studied in the blood. However, little is known about Tfh responses mounted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we studied pTfh to three major structural proteins in individuals recovered from COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh frequencies correlate with neutralizing antibody responses, especially those directed against the spike protein. We also find that pTfh responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase over time. Our findings suggest that pTfh responses against proteins other than the spike protein may contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies and suggests that formation of pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be delayed.",12/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.07.20208488,Paul A.

97,16630,Symptoms and symptom clusters associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based populations: Results from a statewide epidemiological study,"BackgroundPrior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods.

MethodsWe pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsAmong 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection.

ConclusionsSymptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUsing multiple journal articles queried from MEDLINE as well as a Cochrane systematic review, we examined all studies that described symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19. We further examined the guidelines from WHO and CDC on the symptoms those public health authorities consider to be associated with COVID-19. Most of the evidence comes from China, Italy, and the United States. Collectively prior research and guidance suggests there are a dozen symptoms reported by individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in multiple countries. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The evidence is generally of low quality as it is descriptive in nature, and it is biased towards hospitalized patients. Most studies report the proportion of patients hospitalized or testing positive for infection who report one or more symptoms within 3-14 days prior to hospitalization or infection. There has been little validation of symptoms among hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. Furthermore, according to a Cochrane review, no studies to date assess combinations of different signs and symptoms.

Added value of this studyThis study employs multiple, rigorous methods to examine the ability of specific symptoms as well as symptom combinations/groups to predict laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the study is unique in its large sample drawn exclusively from community-based populations rather than hospitalized patients.

Implication of all the available evidenceCombining the evidence from this study with prior research suggests that anosmia and ageusia are key symptoms that differentiate COVID-19 from influenza-like symptoms. Clinical screening protocols for COVID-19 should look for these symptoms, which are not commonly asked of patients who present to urgent care or hospital with flu-like symptoms.

Key pointsImportant symptoms specific to COVID-19 are fever, anosmia, ageusia, and cough. Two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), yet most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. This study confirms using robust methods the key symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and it also identifies combinations of symptoms strongly associated with positive infection",22/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.11.20210922,Brian E Dixon,"Department of Epidemiology, IU Fairbanks School of Public Health",medrxiv,0,0,,
98,17485,Projected COVID-19 epidemic in the United States in the context of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine and implications for social distancing and face mask use,"BackgroundMultiple candidates of COVID-19 vaccines have entered Phase III clinical trials in the United States (US). There is growing optimism that social distancing restrictions and face mask requirements could be eased with widespread vaccine adoption soon.

MethodsWe developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission for the four most severely affected states (New York, Texas, Florida, and California). We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness and coverage required to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic in scenarios when social contact was to return to pre-pandemic levels and face mask use was reduced. Daily and cumulative COVID-19 infection and death cases were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus resource center and used for model calibration.

ResultsWithout a vaccine, the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed in these states by maintaining strict social distancing measures and face mask use levels. But relaxing social distancing restrictions to the pre-pandemic level without changing the current face mask use would lead to a new COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in 0.8-4 million infections and 15,000-240,000 deaths across these four states over the next 12 months. In this scenario, introducing a vaccine would partially offset this negative impact even if the vaccine effectiveness and coverage are relatively low. However, if face mask use is reduced by 50%, a vaccine that is only 50% effective (weak vaccine) would require coverage of 55-94% to suppress the epidemic in these states. A vaccine that is 80% effective (moderate vaccine) would only require 32-57% coverage to suppress the epidemic. In contrast, if face mask usage stops completely, a weak vaccine would not suppress the epidemic, and further major outbreaks would occur. A moderate vaccine with coverage of 48-78% or a strong vaccine (100% effective) with coverage of 33-58% would be required to suppress the epidemic. Delaying vaccination rollout for 1-2 months would not substantially alter the epidemic trend if the current interventions are maintained.

ConclusionsThe degree to which the US population can relax social distancing restrictions and face mask use will depend greatly on the effectiveness and coverage of a potential COVID-19 vaccine if future epidemics are to be prevented. Only a highly effective vaccine will enable the US population to return to life as it was before the pandemic.",30/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221234,Lei Zhang,Xi\'an Jiaotong University,medrxiv,0,0,,
99,17576,Phase II Clinical trial for Evaluation of BCG as potential therapy for COVID-19,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is widely used in national vaccination programs worldwide. It is accepted that BCG alleviates both pathogen and allergy induced respiratory diseases that could also include Covid-19. To investigate this possibility, we randomly assigned 60 Covid-19 patients, after admission to the hospital with pneumonia and requirement for oxygen therapy in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single adult dose of intradermal BCG or normal saline with concomitant standard of care (SoC) medications. Primary endpoints were favorable prognosis of Covid-19 as deduced from resolution of pneumonia, viremia and secondary outcome were enumeration of ICU admissions, duration thereof and mortalities.

ResultsBoth primary and secondary endpoints were significantly improved in the BCG+SoC group. This could be seen from reduction in oxygen requirement due to Covid-19 associated pneumonia decreasing from day 3-4, improved radiological resolution from day 7-15. There were a total of 6 (10%) adverse events in the study of which 2 deaths and 4 ICU admissions were in SoC group (1 ICU admission culminated in death of the subject) and in contrast only 1 ICU admission in the BCG+SoC group. While there was an increase in Covid-19 specific IgG levels in the BCG+SoC group, there was no evidence of BCG induced cytokine storm in this group. Four patients showed localized inflammatory response at the injection site in the BCG+SoC group.

ConclusionsBCG+SoC administration resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with favorable outcomes than did SoC. A third of the patients were naive for childhood BCG vaccination. This mimicked elderly patients in countries with no universal vaccination policy for BCG. No BCG related adversity was seen in this group. The study shows that BCG is a safe, cost-effective treatment that can be introduced as a standard of care in patients with moderate Covid-19 that can reduce requirement of oxygen supplemented beds and disease burden in low resource countries, with additional long-term benefits of reducing risk for tuberculosis.",03/11/2020,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221630,Usha Padmanabhan,"Haffkine Institute for Training, Research & Testing",medrxiv,0,0,,
100,17648,How well does societal mobility restriction help control the COVID-19 pandemic? Evidence from real-time evaluation,"ObjectivesTo determine the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing transmission of COVID-19.

DesignDaily incidence rates lagged by 14 days were regressed on mobility changes using LOESS regression and logit regression between the day of the 100th case in each country to August 31, 2020.

Setting34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan.

ParticipantsGoogle mobility data were obtained from people who turned on mobile device-based global positioning system (GPS) and agreed to share their anonymized position information with Google.

InterventionsWe examined the association of COVID-19 incidence rates with mobility changes, defined as changes in categories of domestic location, against a pre-pandemic baseline, using country-specific daily incidence data on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and mobility data.

ResultsIn two thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. However, these decreases plateaued as mobility remained low or decreased further. We found smaller or negligible associations between mobility restriction and incidence rates in the late phase in most countries.

ConclusionMild to moderate degrees of mobility restriction in most countries were associated with reduced incidence rates of COVID-19 that appear to attenuate over time, while some countries exhibited no effect of such restrictions. More detailed research is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICSince SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic, restrictions on mobility such as limitations on travel and closure of offices, restaurants, and shops have been imposed in an unprecedented way in both scale and scope to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the absence of effective treatment options or a vaccine. Although mobility restriction has also brought about tremendous costs such as negative economic growth and other collateral impacts on health such as increased morbidity and mortality from lack of access to other essential health services, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of mobility restriction for the prevention of disease transmission. A search of PUBMED and Google Scholar for publications on this topic through Sep 20, 2020 revealed that most of the evidence on the effectiveness of physical distancing comes from mathematical modeling studies using a variety of assumptions. One study investigated only the combined effect of several interventions, including physical distancing, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSThis is the first study to investigate the association between change in mobility and incidence of COVID-19 globally using real-time measures of mobility at the population level. For this, we used Google Global Mobility data and the daily incidence of COVID-19 for 36 countries from the day of 100th case detection through August 31, 2020. Our findings from LOESS regression show that in two-thirds of countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. This decrease, however, plateaued as mobility decreased further. We found that associations between mobility restriction and incidence became smaller or negligible in the late phase of the pandemic in most countries. The reduced incidence rate of COVID-19 cases with a mild to moderate degree of mobility restriction in most countries suggests some value to limited mobility restriction in early phases of epidemic mitigation. The lack of impact in some others, however, suggests further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the distinguishing factors for when mobility restrictions are helpful in decreasing viral transmission. Governments should carefully consider the level and period of mobility restriction necessary to achieve the desired benefits and minimize harm.",03/11/2020,10.1101/2020.10.29.20222414,Hwa-Young Lee,"1.

101,17653,"Rapid, simplified whole blood-based multiparameter assay to quantify and phenotype SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells","Rapid tests to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are urgently needed to decipher protective immunity and aid monitoring vaccine-induced immunity. Using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal amount of blood, we measured qualitatively and quantitatively SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell responses in 31 healthcare workers, using flow cytometry. 100% of COVID-19 convalescent participants displayed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response. SARS-CoV-2-responding cells were also detected in 40.9% of participants with no COVID-19-associated symptoms or who tested PCR negative. Phenotypic assessment indicated that, in COVID-19 convalescent participants, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses displayed an early differentiated memory phenotype with limited capacity to produce IFN{gamma}. Conversely, in participants with no reported symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses were enriched in late differentiated cells, co-expressing IFN{gamma} and TNF and also Granzyme B. This proof of concept study presents a scalable alternative to PBMC-based assays to enumerate and phenotype SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells, thus representing a practical tool to monitor adaptive immunity in vaccine trials.

103,17716,Rapid homogeneous assay for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are needed for management of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and will help to examine possible vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal generation.

We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against S and N and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described S construct and a novel N construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S and N. We then compared the LFRET assays with these enzyme immunoassays and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT).

We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%).

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-minute  mix and read assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",04/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.01.20224113,Juuso Rusanen,University of Helsinki,medrxiv,0,0,,
104,17815,"Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccines: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published clinical trials that investigated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of vaccine candidates against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and medRxiv databases were used to select the studies. 7094 articles were identified initially and 43 were retrieved for more detailed evaluation. 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were selected. A total of 1604 subjects with either vaccines or placebo infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, there is an increase in total adverse events for subjects with either low (95% CI: 1.90-4.29) or high (CI: 2.65-5.63) dose vaccination. The adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccine are mainly local ones including pain, itching, and redness, and no significant difference was identified in the systemic reactions. All adverse effects were transient and resolved within a few days. Moreover, the neutralizing and IgG antibody levels post different dose vaccinations were all significantly increased at day 14/21 (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0003, respectively) and day 28/35 (P < 0.00001) in vaccine groups compared to placebo controls. Besides, the levels of neutralizing and IgG antibodies were also elevated significantly at from day 14 to 35, versus day 0 (All P < 0.001). In conclusion, our analysis suggests that the current COVID-19 vaccine candidates are safe, tolerated, and immunogenic, which provides important information for further development, evaluation, and clinical application of COVID-19 vaccine.",04/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.03.20224998,Jialin Zheng,Tongji University School of Medicine,medrxiv,0,0,,
106,18050,"Design and implementation of an international, multi-arm, multi-stage platform master protocol for trials of novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agents: Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO/ACTIV-3)","BackgroundSafe and effective therapies for COVID-19 are urgently needed. In order to meet this need, the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership initiated the Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO). TICO is a multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) platform master protocol, which facilitates the rapid evaluation of the safety and efficacy of novel candidate anti-viral therapeutic agents for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Four agents have so far entered the protocol, with rapid answers already provided for three of these. Other agents are expected to enter the protocol throughout 2021. This protocol contains a number of key design and implementation features that, along with challenges faced by the protocol team, are presented and discussed.

Protocol Design and ImplementationThree clinical trial networks, encompassing a global network of clinical sites, participated in the protocol development and implementation. TICO utilizes a MAMS design with an agile and robust approach to futility and safety evaluation at 300 patients enrolled, with subsequent expansion to full sample size and an expanded target population if the agent shows an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy. Rapid recruitment to multiple agents is enabled through the sharing of placebo as well as the confining of agent-specific information to protocol appendices, and modular consent forms. In collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration, a thorough safety data collection and DSMB schedule was developed for the study of agents with limited in-human data.

ChallengesChallenges included ensuring drug supply and reliable recruitment allowing for changing infection rates across the global network of sites, the need to balance the collection of data and samples without overburdening clinical staff, and obtaining regulatory approvals across a global network of sites.

ConclusionThrough a robust multi-network partnership, the TICO protocol has been successfully used across a global network of sites for rapid generation of efficacy data on multiple novel antiviral agents. The protocol design and implementation features used in this protocol, and the approaches to address challenges, will have broader applicability. Mechanisms to facilitate improved communication and harmonization among country-specific regulatory bodies are required.",08/04/2021,10.1101/2020.11.08.20227876,Daniel D Murray,"CHIP Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity, and Infections, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark",medrxiv,0,0,,
108,18286,Continued Age Shift of Confirmed Positive COVID-19 Incidence Over Time to Children and Young Adults: Washington State March - August 2020,"BackgroundAs the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic passed the initial infection peak in Washington State, phased re-opening lifted stay-at-home orders and restrictions leading to increased non-essential work, social activities and gathering, especially among younger persons.

MethodsA longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution 1) March-April 2020 (N=13,934) and 2) March-August 2020 (N=76,032) for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance.

ResultsFrom March 1st to April 19, 2020 COVID-19 case positive age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p <.001). Number of cases over the eight-week analysis period were 0-19 years n = 515, 20-39 years n = 4078, 40-59 years n =4788, 60-79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. After the peak (March 22, 2020), as incidence declined in older age groups, the combined percentage of cases age 0-19 and 20-39 increased from 20% to 40% of total cases. During this time testing expanded with more testing among older age groups while case positivity shifted young. Percent positive cases by age through August 2020 increased to a consistent average of 60% less than age 40 [age 0-19 increased to 19% (N = 10257), age 20-39 increased to 42% (N = 30215)].

ConclusionsAn increased share of COVID-19 incidence among children (age 0-19) and young adults (age 20-39) indicates their elevated role in propagating the epidemic by creating a reservoir of disease with risk of spillovers to more vulnerable older persons and those with comorbid conditions. Media savvy and age appropriate COVID-19 messaging may increase mitigation compliance among these less vulnerable, more mobile and lower priority vaccination age groups. As vaccines become available, mitigation will continue to be a priority to reduce overall population incidence.",16/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.12.20229468,Judith Malmgren,University of Washington,medrxiv,0,0,,

110,18414,Low Dose Radiation Therapy for COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Pilot Study,"BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as pandemic in March 2020. Currently there is no vaccine or specific effective treatment for COVID-19. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. Radiation in low doses (<100 cGy) has been known for its anti-inflammatory effect and therefore, low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) to lungs can potentially mitigate the severity of pneumonia and reduce mortality. We conducted a pilot trial to study the feasibility and clinical efficacy of LDRT to lungs in the management of patients with COVID-19.

MethodsFrom June to Aug 2020, we enrolled 10 patients with COVID-19 having moderate to severe risk disease [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of [&ge;]5]. Patients were treated as per the standard COVID-19 management guidelines along with LDRT to both lungs with a dose of 70cGy in single fraction. Response assessment was done based on the clinical parameters using the NEWS.

ResultsAll patients completed the prescribed treatment. Nine patients had complete clinical recovery mostly within a period ranging from 3-7 days. One patient, who was a known hypertensive, showed clinical deterioration and died 24 days after LDRT. No patients showed the signs of acute radiation toxicity.

ConclusionResults of our study (90% response rate) suggest the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of LDRT in COVID-19 patients having moderate to severe risk disease. This mandates a randomized controlled trial to establish the clinical efficacy of LDRT in COVID-19 pneumonia.",18/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.16.20231514,Daya Nand Sharma,"AIIMS, New Delhi",medrxiv,0,0,,
111,18535,Assessment of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in Los Angeles,"ImportanceHealthcare workers (HCW) are slated to be early recipients of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines due to increased risk of exposure to patients with COVID-19, and will be tasked with administering approved vaccines to the general population. As lynchpins of the vaccination effort, HCWs opinions of a vaccines safety and efficacy may affect both public perception and uptake of the vaccine. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and address potential hesitancy prior to vaccine administration.

ObjectiveTo understand healthcare workers attitudes about vaccine safety, efficacy, and acceptability in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including acceptance of a novel coronavirus vaccine.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsA cross-sectional survey was distributed to participants enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study surveilling SARS-CoV-2 infection among 1,093 volunteer sampled University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System employees. Surveys were completed online between September 24 and October 16, 2020. In total, 609 participants completed this supplemental survey.

ResultsWe averaged a 9-statement Likert scale matrix scored from 1 (""strongly disagree"") to 5 (""strongly agree"") and found respondents overwhelmingly confident about vaccine safety (4.47); effectiveness (4.44); importance, self-protection, and community health (4.67). Notably, 47.3% of respondents reported unwillingness to participate in a coronavirus vaccine trial, and most (66.5%) intend to delay vaccination. The odds of reporting intent to delay coronavirus vaccine uptake were 4.15 times higher among nurses, 2.45 times higher among other personnel with patient contact roles, and 2.15 times higher among those without patient contact compared to doctors. Evolving SARS-CoV-2 science (76.0%), current political climate (57.6%), and fast-tracked vaccine development timeline (83.4%) were cited as primary variables impacting HCW decisions to undergo vaccination. Of note, these results were obtained prior to release of Phase III data from companies manufacturing vaccines in the U.S.

Conclusions and RelevanceDespite overall confidence in vaccines, a majority of HCW expressed concerns over a novel coronavirus vaccine. A large proportion plan to delay vaccine uptake due to concerns about expedited development, emerging scientific discoveries, and the political climate. Forthcoming vaccination campaigns must address these unique points of coronavirus vaccine hesitancy in order to achieve adequate vaccine coverage.",19/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.18.20234468,Anne W Rimoin,"University of California, Los Angeles",medrxiv,0,0,,
112,18825,Exploring Risks of Human Challenge Trials for COVID-19,"Human Challenge Trials (HCTs) are a potential method to accelerate development of vaccines and therapeutics. However, HCTs for COVID-19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this paper, we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a SARS-COV-2 dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID-19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality risks (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. The model estimates individual risk, which we then extrapolate to overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study. We provide a web tool to explore risk under different study designs.

Based on the Bayesian model, IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age is 15.1 in 100,000, with a 95% uncertainty interval from 11.8 to 19.2, while risk of hospitalization is 130 per 100,000 (100 to 160). However, risk will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, selecting lower-risk population, and providing treatment. Accounting for this with stronger assumptions, we project the fatality risk to be as low as 2.5 per 100,000 (1.6 to 3.9) and the hospitalization risk to be 22.0 per 100,000 (14.0 to 33.7). We therefore find a 50-person dosing trial has a 99.74% (99.8% to 99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.9% (98.3% to 99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization.",12/03/2021,10.1101/2020.11.19.20234658,David Manheim,1DaySooner,medrxiv,0,0,,
113,18576,"COVID-19 optimal vaccination policies: a modeling study on efficacy, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses","At the date, Europe and part of North America face the second wave of COVID-19, causing more than 1 300 000 deaths worldwide. Humanity lacks successful treatments, and a sustainable solution is an effective vaccine. Pfizer and the Russian Gamaleya Institute report that its vaccines reach more than 90 % efficacy in a recent press release. If third stage trial results favorable, pharmaceutical firms estimate big scale production of its vaccine candidates around the first 2021 quarter and the World Health organization fix as objective, vaccinate 20 % of the whole population at the final of 2021. However, since COVID-19 is new to our knowledge, vaccine efficacy and induced-immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but few think the first vaccines will be fully protective. Instead, they may reduce the severity of illness, reducing hospitalization and death cases.

Further, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. For this reason, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses.

Our contribution answers questions in this direction. According to the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization Working Group on COVID-19 Vaccines, we formulate an optimal controlled model to describe vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. Additionally, we analyze the reproductive vaccination number according to vaccination profiles depending on coverage, efficacy, horizon time, and vaccination rate. We explore scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced immunity, and natural immunity via numerical simulation. Our results suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and natural immunity would play a dominant role in the vaccination policy design. Likewise, the vaccine efficacy would influence the time of intensifying the number of doses in the vaccination policy.",20/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.19.20235176,Saul Diaz-Infante,CONACYT - Universidad de Sonora,medrxiv,0,0,,
114,18688,BCG vaccine derived peptides induce SARS-CoV-2 T cell cross-reactivity,"Epidemiological studies suggest that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine may have protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and, there are now more than 15 ongoing clinical trials seeking to determine if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 (1). However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific T cell response is unknown. Here, in silico, we identify 8 BCG derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 or NSP13 derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its corresponding SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG derived peptides. Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG derived peptides developed enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the epidemiologic observation that BCG vaccination confers protection from COVID-19; and supports the use of BCG vaccination to induce cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses.",23/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.21.20236018,Joshua D Ooi,Monash University,medrxiv,0,0,,
115,18772,Evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid systematic review,"ObjectiveTo review evidence of the effectiveness of travel measures implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to recommend change on how evidence is incorporated in the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).

DesignWe used an abbreviated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) and a search strategy aimed to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures (advice, entry and exit screening, medical examination or vaccination requirements, isolation or quarantine, the refusal of entry, and entry restrictions), pre-printed or published by June 1, 2020.

ResultsWe identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled (vs. observational). Thirteen studies investigated international measures while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both), including suspended transportation (24 studies), border restrictions (21), and screening (5). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the identified studies investigated the initial export of cases out of Wuhan, which was found to be highly effective, but few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures failed to account for domestic travel measures, and thus likely led to biased estimates. Poor data and other factors contributed to the low quality of the studies identified.

ConclusionTravel measures, especially those implemented in Wuhan, played a key role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the effectiveness of these measures was short-lived. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps, but also a need to review the way in which evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak.

What is already known on this subject?O_LIPrevious reviews of the evidence from outbreaks of influenza and other infectious disease have generally found that there is limited evidence that travel-measures are effective at containing outbreaks.
C_LIO_LIHowever, it is unclear if the lessons from other infectious disease outbreaks would be relevant in the context of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIBased on evidence at the time, WHO did not recommend any travel restrictions when it declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
C_LI

What does this study add?O_LIThis study rapidly reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of travel measures implemented in the early phase of the pandemic on epidemiological countries.
C_LIO_LIThe study investigated both international and domestic travel measures and a wide range of travel measures.
C_LIO_LIThe study finds that the domestic travel measures implemented in Wuhan were effective at reducing the importation of cases internationally and within China. The study also finds that travel measures are more effective when implemented earlier in the outbreak.
C_LIO_LIThe findings generate recommendations on how to incorporate evidence into the International Health Regulations and highlights important research gaps that remain.
C_LI

How might this affect future outbreaks?O_LIThe findings of this study suggest the need to decouple recommendations of travel measures from the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.
C_LIO_LIHighlights the need to evaluate the potential effectiveness of travel measures for each outbreak, and not just assume effectiveness based on past outbreak scnearios.

We aimed to identify optimal symptom combinations to capture most cases using fewer tests with implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers across different resource settings and public health.

MethodsUK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one case (test per case [TPC]) were calculated for different symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

FindingsUK and US cohorts included 122,305 (1,202 positives) and 3,162 (79 positive) individuals. Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 TPC. The combination with highest sensitivity (fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat) identified 96% cases requiring 96 TPC.

Insights from a Global Physician Survey,"IntroductionCOVID-19 immunity passports could protect the right to free movement, but critics worry about insufficient evidence, privacy, fraud, and discrimination. We aimed to characterize the global physician communitys opinion regarding immunity passports.

MethodsCross sectional, random stratified sample of physicians registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. The survey aimed to sample 1,000 physicians divided among the USA, EU and rest of the world. The survey question on immunology asked physicians to offer their insights into whether we know enough about COVID-19 immunity and its duration to offer immunity passports at the present time.

ResultsThe survey was completed by 1004 physicians (67 specialties, 40 countries, 49% frontline specialties) with a mean (SD) age of 49.14 (12) years. Overall, 52% answered NO, 17% were UNCERTAIN, and 31% answered YES (P <0.05). EU physicians were more likely to sayYES but even among them it did not exceed 35% approval.

118,19034,Title: Immunity status of Health Care Workers post recovery from COVID-19: An online longitudinal panel survey,"BackgroundCorona virus has literally travelled ""around the world in 80 days"" akin to Fogg and Passepartoute of Jules Verne fame. Manning of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wards and ICUs, also surgery on COVID-positive patients is increasingly being relegated to that subset of health care workers (HCW) who themselves have resumed duties after surviving COVID-19 infection. Convalescent plasma therapy has been widely endorsed. Several vaccines are in the pipeline as potential preventive measures against the virus keeping HCW on the priority-list of recipients. Immunity passports are being validated for foreign travel. These events share a common presumption that exposure to COVID-19 virus (natural infection/inoculation) produces protective adaptive immunity. It is unknown whether all (COVID-19) infected patients mount a protective immune response and for how long any protective effect will last.

MethodsThis single institutional prospective longitudinal panel survey questions were deployed to the respondents online via email/WhatsApp groups to ascertain the symptomology and immunity status of HCW in the months following COVID-19 infection. The survey was administered to the same set/cohort of health care workers over 6 months.

Results165 responses from 151 respondents (70 at 1-2months; 95 at 3-4 months including 14 at both time points) were analysed. 7.14% of infected HCW failed to develop IgG antibodies at 4-6 weeks. 91.7% HCW with IgG titres in the highest bracket had experienced anosmia. Mean antibody titres were 12.08 {+/-} 9.56 and 9.72 {+/-} 9.34 at 1-2 months and 3-4 months post-development of first symptom, respectively.

ConclusionUnderstanding of COVID-19 patterns of variation in HCW may guide their deployment in the COVID ward and COVID-OTs. Revelation of this enigma (by quantification of serial IgG antibody levels) is critical for predicting response to vaccines under trial, fostering effective stratagems and tactics for pandemic control, ascertaining validity of immunity passports and understanding longevity/durability of protection by forecasting immunological memory against SARS-CoV-2.",30/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.27.20239426,Shagun Bhatia Shah,Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre,medrxiv,0,0,,

ObjectivesTo describe the characteristics of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating prophylaxis or treatment of Covid-19 infection and examine the effect of trial characteristics on whether the study reported a statistically significant effect on the primary outcome(s).

Study DesignMeta-epidemiological study of Covid-19 treatment and prophylaxis RCTs.

Eligibility criteriaEnglish-language RCTs (peer-reviewed or preprint) that evaluated pharmacologic agents or blood products compared to standard care, placebo, or an active comparator among participants with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 or at risk for Covid-19. We excluded trials of vaccines or traditional herbal medicines.

Information sourcesWe searched 25 databases in the US Centre for Disease Control Downloadable Database from January 1 to October 21, 2020.

Trial appraisal and synthesis methodsWe extracted trial characteristics including number of centres, funding sources (industry versus non-industry), and sample size. We assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the modified Cochrane RoB 2.0 Tool. We used descriptive statistics to summarize trial characteristics and logistic regression to evaluate the association between RoB due to the randomization process, centre status (single vs. multicentre), funding source, and sample size, and statistically significant effect in the primary outcome.

ResultsWe included 91 RCTs (46,802 participants) evaluating Covid-19 therapeutic drugs (n = 76), blood products (n = 9) or prophylactic drugs (n = 6). Of these, 40 (44%) were single-centre, 23 (25.3%) enrolled < 50 patients, and 28 (30.8%) received industry funding. RoB varied across trials, with high or probably high overall RoB in 75 (82.4%) trials, most frequently due to deviations from the intended protocol (including blinding) and randomization processes. Thirty-eight trials (41.8%) found a statistically significant effect in the primary outcome. RoB due randomization (odds ratio [OR] 3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 9.72) and single centre trials (OR 3.15, 95% CI, 1.25 to 7.97) were associated with higher likelihood of finding a statistically significant effect.

ConclusionsThere was high variability in RoB amongst Covid-19 trials. RoB attributed to the randomization process and single centre status were associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of finding a statistically significant effect. Researchers, funders, and knowledge users should remain cognizant of the impact of study characteristics, including RoB, on trial results when designing, conducting, and appraising Covid-19 trials.",30/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.29.20237875,Kimia Honarmand,Western University,medrxiv,0,0,,

The 95% posterior interval for the efficacy of the half+full dose regime is 66.6-96.3%, while for the 2x full dose regime it is 39.0-74.8%. Hence, it is possible that in both dosage regimes the vaccine has similar efficacy, around 70%. The estimated efficacy for the Pfizer vaccine is 89.9-97.4% and for Moderna 86.3-97.5%.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of sulodexide when used in the early clinical stages of COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a single-centre, outpatient setting, randomised controlled trial with a parallel-group design in Mexico. Including patients within three days of clinical symptom onset, who were at a high risk of severe clinical progression due to chronic comorbidities. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an oral dose of sulodexide (500 LRU twice a day) or the placebo for 21 days. Primary outcomes were need and length of hospitalisation, need and length of oxygen support.

ResultsBetween June 5 and August 30, 2020, 243 patients were included in the ""per-protocol"" analysis. One hundred twenty-four of them received sulodexide, while 119 received placeboes. At 21 days follow-up, 22 of 124 patients required hospitalisation in the sulodexide group compared to 35 of 119 in the placebo group [relative risk (RR), 0{middle dot}6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0{middle dot}37-0{middle dot}96; p=0{middle dot}03]. Fewer patients required oxygen support in the sulodexide group [37 of 124 vs. 50 of 119; RR, 0{middle dot}71; 95% CI, 0{middle dot}5 to 1; p=0{middle dot}05], and for fewer days (9{+/-}7{middle dot}2 in the sulodexide group vs. 11{middle dot}5{+/-}9{middle dot}6 in the placebo group; p=0{middle dot}02). There was no between-group difference concerning the length of hospital stay.

InterpretationEarly intervention in COVID-19 patients with sulodexide reduced hospital admissions and oxygen support requirements, although with no significant effect on mortality. This has beneficial implications in the patient well-being, making sulodexide a favourable medication until an effective vaccine or an antiviral becomes available.

123,19406,"Multifaceted strategies for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities in Ontario, Canada","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe outbreaks in Canadian long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3% - 28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2-4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4% - 96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5% - 96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination. Vaccination could have a substantial impact on mitigating disease burden among residents, but may not eliminate the need for other measures before population-level control of COVID-19 is achieved.",31/03/2021,10.1101/2020.12.04.20244194,Seyed M.

124,19391,On the Effects of Misclassification in Estimating Efficacy With Application to Recent COVID-19 Vaccine Trials,"The recent trials for proposed COVID-19 vaccines have garnered a considerable amount of attention and as of this writing extensive vaccination efforts are underway. The first two vaccines approved in the United States are the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines both with estimated efficacy near 95%. One question which has received limited attention, and which we address here, is what affect false positives or false negatives have on the estimated efficacy. Expressions for potential bias due to misclassification of COVID status are developed as are general formulas to adjust for misclassification, allowing for either differential or non-differential misclassification. These results are illustrated with numerical investigations pertinent to the Moderna and Pfizer trials. The general conclusion, fortunately, is that the potential misclassification of COVID status almost always would lead to underestimation of the efficacy and that correcting for false positives or negatives will typically lead to even higher estimated efficacy.",03/04/2021,10.1101/2020.12.04.20244244,John P Buonaccorsi,University of Massachusetts-Amherst,medrxiv,0,0,,
125,19412,Exploring drugs and vaccines associated with altered risks and severity of COVID-19: a UK Biobank cohort study of all ATC level-4 drug categories,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a major public health concern, yet its risk factors are not well-understood and effective therapies are lacking. It remains unclear how different drugs may increase or decrease the risks of infection and severity of disease.

MethodsWe studied associations of prior use of all level-4 ATC drug categories (including vaccines) with COVID-19 diagnosis and outcome, based on a prospective cohort of UK Biobank(UKBB). Drug history was based on general practitioner(GP) records. Effects of prescribed medications/vaccinations on the risk of infection, severity of disease and mortality were investigated separately. Hospitalized and fatal cases were categorized as  severe infection. We also considered different study designs and conducted analyses within infected patients, tested subjects and the whole population respectively, and for 5 different time-windows of prescriptions. Missing data were accounted for by multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting was employed to reduce testing bias. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted which controls for main confounders.

ResultsWe placed a greater focus on protective associations here, as (residual) confounding by indication and comorbidities tends to bias towards harmful effects. Across all categories, statins showed the strongest and most consistent protective associations. Significant protective effects against severe infection were seen among infected subjects (OR for prescriptions within a 12-month window, same below: 0.50, 95% CI:0.42-0.60), tested subjects (OR=0.63, 0.54-0.73) or in the general population (OR=0.49, 0.42-0.57). A number of top-listed drugs with protective effects were also cardiovascular medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blocker and beta-blockers. Some other drugs showing protective associations included biguanides (metformin), estrogens, thyroid hormones and proton pump inhibitors, among others.

Interestingly, we also observed protective associations by numerous vaccines. The most consistent association was observed for influenza vaccines, which showed reduced odds of infection (OR= 0.73 for vaccination in past year, CI 0.65-0.83) when compared cases to general population controls or test-negative controls (OR=0.60, 0.53-0.68). Protective associations were also observed when severe or fatal infection was considered as the outcome. Pneumococcal, tetanus, typhoid and combined bacterial and viral vaccines (ATC code J07CA) were also associated with lower odds of infection/severity.

Further subgroup and interaction analyses revealed difference in protective effects in different clinical subgroups. For example, protective effects of flu and pneumococcal vaccines were weaker in obese individuals, while we observed stronger protective effects of statins in those with cardiometabolic disorders, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension and obesity.

ConclusionsA number of drugs, including many for cardiometabolic disorders, may be associated with lower odds of infection/severity of infection. Several existing vaccines, especially flu vaccines, may be beneficial against COVID-19 as well. However, causal relationship cannot be established due to risk of confounding. While further studies are required to validate the findings, this work provides a useful reference for future meta-analyses, clinical trials or experimental studies.",28/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.05.20244426,Hon-Cheong So,Chinese University of Hong Kong,medrxiv,0,0,,
126,19639,A Simplified Bayesian Analysis Method for Vaccine Efficacy,"We describe a simplified Bayesian analysis of vaccine trial data, in which a reparametrization of the Poisson likelihood leads to a factorization in which the protective vaccine efficacy VES and the nuisance parameter appear in different factors. As a consequence the posterior density acquires a factorized form, and marginalization over the nuisance parameter is trivial. Estimates of VES accordingly become a matter of simple manipulations of one-dimensional posterior probability densities.

127,19478,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays for antibody monitoring in natural infection and vaccine trials,"Determinants of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the development of well-standardized, reproducible antibody assays to be utilized in concert with clinical trials to establish correlates of risk and protection. This need has led to the appearance of a variety of neutralization assays used by different laboratories and companies. Using plasma samples from COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate disease from a localized outbreak in a single region of the western US, we compared three platforms for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization: assay with live SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus assay utilizing lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging, and a surrogate ELISA test. Vero, Vero E6, HEK293T cells expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were evaluated. Live-virus and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T cells showed similar geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging 141-178, but VSV-pseudovirus assay yielded significantly higher GMT (310 95%CI 211-454; p < 0.001). Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) titers from live-virus and all pseudovirus assay readouts were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81-0.89). ND50 titers positively correlated with plasma concentration of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) (r = 0.63-0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46-0.73). There was a moderate positive correlation between age and spike (Spearmans rho=0.37, p=0.02), RBD (rho=0.39, p=0.013) and nucleoprotein IgG (rho=0.45, p=0.003). ND80 showed stronger correlation with age than ND50 (ND80 rho=0.51 (p=0.001), ND50 rho=0.28 (p=0.075)).

128,19524,Characterising long term Covid-19: a living systematic review,"BackgroundWhile it is now apparent clinical sequelae (often called Long Covid) may persist after acute Covid-19, their nature, frequency, and aetiology are poorly characterised. This study aims to regularly synthesise evidence on Long Covid characteristics, to inform clinical management, rehabilitation, and interventional studies to improve long term outcomes.

MethodsA living systematic review. Medline, CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (Ovid), WHO Global Research Database on Covid-19, LitCOVID, and Google Scholar were searched up to 17th March 2021. Published studies including at least 100 people with confirmed or clinically suspected Covid-19 at 12 weeks or more post-onset were included. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and meta-analyses to estimate prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

ResultsThirty-nine studies were included: 32 cohort, six cross-sectional, and one case-control. Most showed high or moderate risk of bias. None were set in low-income countries, limited studies included children. Studies reported on 10,951 people (48% female) in 12 countries. Most followed-up post hospital discharge (78%, 8520/10951). The longest mean follow-up was 221.7 (SD: 10.9) days post Covid-19 onset. An extensive range of symptoms with wide prevalence was reported, most commonly weakness (41%; 95% CI 25% to 59%), malaise (33%; 95% CI 15% to 57%), fatigue (31%; 95% CI 24% to 39%), concentration impairment (26%; 95% CI 21% to 32%), and breathlessness (25%; 95% CI 18% to 34%). Other frequent symptoms included musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychological. 37% (95% CI 18% to 60%) of people reported reduced quality of life.

ConclusionLong Covid is a complex condition with heterogeneous symptoms. The nature of the studies precludes a precise case definition or evaluation of risk factors. There is an urgent need for prospective, robust, standardised controlled studies into aetiology, risk factors, and biomarkers to characterise Long Covid in different at-risk populations and settings.

129,19594,Artificial intelligence-enabled analysis of UK and US public attitudes on Facebook and Twitter towards COVID-19 vaccinations,"BackgroundGlobal efforts towards the development and deployment of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly advancing. We developed and applied an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the UK and the US towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to understand public attitude and identify topics of concern.

MethodsOver 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1st March - 22nd November 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.

ResultsWe found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.

ConclusionsAI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. This could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccinations, help address concerns of vaccine-sceptics and develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximise uptake.",11/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.08.20246231,Amir Hussain,"Edinburgh Napier University, UK",medrxiv,0,0,,
131,19659,"Projecting the impact of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundA number of highly effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and approved for mass vaccination. We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada.

MethodsWe used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program according to tested schedules in clinical trials for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, prioritizing healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older. Daily vaccination rate was parameterized based on vaccine administration data. Using estimates of vaccine efficacy, we projected the impact of vaccination on the overall attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths. We further investigated the effect of increased daily contacts at different stages during vaccination campaigns on outbreak control.

ResultsMaintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with an average of 74% reduction in daily contacts, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 27.3% (95% CrI: 22.3% - 32.4%) and 27.0% (95% CrI: 21.9% - 32.6%), respectively, over a one-year time horizon. The largest benefits of vaccination were observed in preventing deaths with reductions of 31.5% (95% CrI: 22.5% - 39.7%) and 31.9% (95% CrI: 22.0% - 41.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, compared to no vaccination. We found that an increase of only 10% in daily contacts at the end of lockdown, when vaccination coverage with only one dose was 6%, would trigger a surge in the outbreak. Early relaxation of population-wide measures could lead to a substantial increase in the number of infections, potentially reaching levels observed during the peak of the second wave in Ontario.

ConclusionsVaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Sustaining population-wide NPIs, to allow for a sufficient increase in population-level immunity through vaccination, is essential to prevent future outbreaks.",18/03/2021,10.1101/2020.12.10.20246827,Kevin Zhang,University of Toronto,medrxiv,0,0,,
133,19737,Public Preferences for Social Distancing Behaviors to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"Policies to promote social distancing can minimize COVID-19 transmission, but come with substantial social and economic costs. Quantifying relative preferences of the public for such practices can inform policy prioritization and optimize uptake. We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to quantify relative ""utilities"" (preferences) for five COVID-19 pandemic social distances strategies (e.g., closure of restaurants, restriction of large gatherings) against the hypothetical risk of acquiring COVID-19 and anticipated income loss. The survey was distributed in Missouri in May-June, 2020. We applied inverse probability sampling weights to mixed logit and latent class models to generate mean preferences and identify preference classes. Overall (n=2,428), the strongest preference was for the prohibition of large gatherings, followed by preferences to keep outdoor venues, schools, and social and lifestyle venues open, 75% of the population showing probable support for a strategy that prohibited large gatherings and closed lifestyle and social venues. Latent class analysis, however revealed four preference sub-groups in the population - ""risk eliminators"", ""risk balancers"", ""altruistic"" and ""risk takers"", with men twice as likely as women to belong to the risk-taking group. In this setting, public health policies which as a first phase prohibit large gatherings, as well as close social and lifestyle venues may be acceptable and adhered to by the public. In addition, policy messages that address preference heterogeneity, for example by targeting public health messages at men, could improve adherence to social distancing measures and prevent further COVID-19 transmission prior to vaccine distribution and in the event of future pandemics.

Significance StatementPreferences drive behavior - DCEs are a novel tool in public health that allow examination of preferences for a product, service or policy, identifying how the public prioritizes personal risks and cost in relation to health behaviors. Using this method to establish preferences for COVID-19 mitigation strategies, our results suggest that, firstly, a tiered approach to non-essential business closures where large gatherings are prohibited and social and lifestyle venues are closed as a first phase, would be well aligned with population preferences and may be supported by the public, while school and outdoor venue closures may require more consideration prior to a second phase of restrictions. And secondly, that important distinct preference phenotypes - that are not captured by sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex, race) characteristics - exist, and therefore that messaging should be target at such subgroups to enhance adherence to prevention efforts.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.12.20248103,Ingrid Eshun-Wilson,Washington University in St. Louis,medrxiv,0,0,,
134,19787,Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission may prevent or dampen a spring wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths in 2021,"Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials assess vaccine efficacy against disease (VEDIS), the ability of a vaccine to block symptomatic COVID-19. They will only partially discriminate whether VEDIS is mediated by preventing infection as defined by the detection of virus in the airways (vaccine efficacy against infection defined as VESUSC), or by preventing symptoms despite breakthrough infection (vaccine efficacy against symptoms or VESYMP). Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEINF), defined as the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine recipients versus from infected placebo recipients, is also not being measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King County Washington, we demonstrate that if the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which have observed VEDIS>90%, mediate VEDIS predominately by complete protection against infection, then prevention of a fourth epidemic wave in the spring of 2021, and associated reduction of subsequent cases and deaths by 60%, is likely to occur assuming rapid enough vaccine roll out. If high VEDIS is explained primarily by reduction in symptoms, then VEINF>50% will be necessary to prevent or limit the extent of this fourth epidemic wave. The potential added benefits of high VEINF would be evident regardless of vaccine allocation strategy and would be enhanced if vaccine roll out rate is low or if available vaccines demonstrate waning immunity. Finally, we demonstrate that a 1.0 log vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to achieve VEINF=60% and that human challenge studies with 104 infected participants, or clinical trials in a university student population could estimate VESUSC, VESYMP and VEINF using viral load metrics.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.13.20248120,Joshua T Schiffer,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,medrxiv,0,0,,
135,19728,COVID-19 vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not block infection need higher coverage and faster rollout to achieve population impact,"BackgroundSeveral COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in the final stage of testing. Interim trial results for two vaccines suggest at least 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease (VEDIS). It remains unknown whether this efficacy is mediated predominately by lowering SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility (VESUSC) or development of symptoms after infection (VESYMP). A vaccine with high VESYMP but low VESUSC has uncertain population impact.

MethodsWe developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to demographic, physical distancing and epidemic data from King County, Washington. Different rollout scenarios starting December 2020 were simulated assuming different combinations of VESUSC and VESYMP resulting in up to 100% VEDIS with constant vaccine effects over 1 year. We assumed no further increase in physical distancing despite expanding case numbers and no reduction of infectivity upon infection conditional on presence of symptoms. Proportions of cumulative infections, hospitalizations and deaths prevented over 1 year from vaccination start are reported.

ResultsRollouts of 1M vaccinations (5,000 daily) using vaccines with 50% VEDIS are projected to prevent 30%-58% of infections and 38%-58% of deaths over one year. In comparison, vaccines with 90% VEDIS are projected to prevent 47%-78% of the infections and 58%-77% of deaths over one year. In both cases, there is a greater reduction if VEDIS is mediated mostly by VESUSC. The use of a ""symptom reducing"" vaccine will require twice as many people vaccinated than a ""susceptibility reducing"" vaccine with the same 90% VEDIS to prevent 50% of the infections and death over one year. Delaying the start of the vaccination by 3 months decreases the expected population impact by approximately 40%.

ConclusionsVaccines which prevent COVID-19 disease but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby shift symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, will prevent fewer infections and require larger and faster vaccination rollouts to have population impact, compared to vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection. If uncontrolled transmission across the U.S. continues, then expected vaccination in Spring 2021 will provide only limited benefit.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.13.20248142,Dobromir T Dimitrov,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,medrxiv,0,0,,
136,19786,Assessing Durability of Vaccine Effect Following Blinded Crossover in COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials,"BackgroundSeveral candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 disease have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials and some have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. Efficacious vaccines should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which will occur before long-term efficacy and safety are known.

MethodsFollowing vaccination of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be derived by assuming the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both vaccine durability and potential vaccine-associated enhanced disease.

ResultsPost-crossover estimates of vaccine efficacy can provide insights about durability, identify waning efficacy, and identify late enhancement of disease, but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As vaccine efficacy estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior vaccine efficacy estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late vaccine efficacy. Further, open-label crossover may lead to riskier behavior in the immediate crossover period for the unblinded vaccine arm, confounding vaccine efficacy estimates for all post-crossover periods.

ConclusionsWe advocate blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess vaccine durability and potential delayed enhancement of disease. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunological and clinical effectiveness over time.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.14.20248137,Dean Follmann,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,medrxiv,0,0,,

We observed the co-circulation of at least 13 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time, which were linked to multiple importations and characterized by large transmission clusters concomitant with a high number of infections. Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as ""hidden reservoirs"" during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave. Our results suggest that the efficacy of public health interventions is, ultimately, limited by the size and structure of epidemic reservoirs, which may warrant prioritization during vaccine deployment.",19/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.16.20248355,Massimo Ciccozzi,Campus Biomedical University of Rome,medrxiv,0,0,,

141,20296,REAL-TIME MECHANISTIC BAYESIAN FORECASTS OF COVID-19 MORTALITY,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late December 2019. In the first six months of the global outbreak, the US reported more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. Effective modeling of the course of the pandemic can help assist with public health resource planning, intervention efforts, and vaccine clinical trials. However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR model. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model and show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top 2 models out of 10 submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.",24/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.22.20248736,Daniel Sheldon,University of Massachusetts Amherst,medrxiv,0,0,,

All individuals (n=200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses and the results were compared with those from historical controls (n=595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both viral antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased more steadily (over summer) in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all adults surveyed by mid-December 2020. The population seropositivity rate again increased more rapidly as cases rose over the winter period. By the end of February 2021, [~]19% ([~]one-in-five) in this study group tested seropositive. Notably, 96% of random seropositive samples screened (n=56), displayed virus neutralizing responses, with titers comparable to those engendered by recently approved mRNA vaccines, supporting that milder infections generally provoke a competent B cell response. These data offer baseline information about the level of seropositivity in this group of active adults in the Stockholm metropolitan area following a full year of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and prior to the introduction of vaccines.

Structured abstractO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSSweden did not enforce social lockdown in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, we sought to determine the proportion of seropositive healthy, active adults in Stockholm, the countrys most populous region. Random sampling (of blood donors and pregnant women) was carried out during the first year following virus emergence in the country and prior to vaccination of the general adult population - allowing for an estimate of seroprevalence in response to natural infection.

DesignIn this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n=2,600) and pregnant women(n=2,500) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at four intervals) between 14th March and 28th February 2021. Sera from all participants and a cohort of historical controls (n=595) were screened for IgG responses against trimers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the smaller receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard analytical approaches, a probabilistic (cut-off-independent) Bayesian framework that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze data over time. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority: registration number 2020-01807.

SettingHealthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through Karolinska University Hospital.

ParticipantsNone of the participants were symptomatic at sampling. No additional metadata was available from the samples.

ResultsBlood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 13th December 2020. By the end of February 2021, when deaths were in decline and at low levels following their winter peak, 19% of the population tested seropositive. Notably, 96% of seropositive healthy donors screened (n=56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to, or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response.

ConclusionsThese data indicate that in the year since the start of community transmission, seropositivity levels in metropolitan Stockholm had reached approximately one-in-five persons, providing important baseline seroprevalence information prior to the start of vaccination.",07/04/2021,10.1101/2020.12.24.20248821,Xaquin C Dopico,Karolinska Institutet,medrxiv,0,0,,
143,20415,Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"BackgroundVaccination is crucial to address the COVID-19 pandemic but vaccine hesitancy could undermine control efforts. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK population, identify which population subgroups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and report stated reasons for vaccine hesitancy.

MethodsNationally representative survey data from 12,035 participants were collected from 24th November to 1st December 2020 for wave 6 of the  Understanding Society COVID-19 web survey. Participants were asked how likely or unlikely they would be to have a vaccine if offered and their main reason for hesitancy. Cross-sectional analysis assessed prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and logistic regression models conducted.

FindingsOverall intention to be vaccinated was high (82% likely/very likely). Vaccine hesitancy was higher in women (21.0% vs 14.7%), younger age groups (26.5% in 16-24 year olds vs 4.5% in 75+) and less educated (18.6% no qualifications vs 13.2% degree qualified). Vaccine hesitancy was particularly high in Black (71.8%), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (42.3%), Mixed (32.4%) and non-UK/Irish White (26.4%) ethnic groups. Fully adjusted models showed gender, education and ethnicity were independently associated with vaccine hesitancy. Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy were 12.96 (95% CI:7.34, 22.89) in the Black/Black British and 2.31 (95% CI:1.55, 3.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups (compared to White British/Irish ethnicity) and 3.24 (95%CI:1.93, 5.45) for people with no qualifications compared to degree educated. The main reason for hesitancy was fears over unknown future effects.

InterpretationOlder people at greatest COVID-19 mortality risk expressed the greatest willingness to be vaccinated but Black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups had greater vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine programmes should prioritise measures to improve uptake in specific minority ethnic groups.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Embase and Medline up to November 16, 2020, using key words ""vaccine hesitancy"" and ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"". Vaccine hesitancy is complex but also context specific. Previous research about vaccine hesitancy relates to existing adult and childhood vaccines, with limited evidence currently available on willingness to be vaccinated for newly available COVID-19 vaccines. Existing vaccination programmes often have lower uptake among more socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Uptake of vaccines has often varied across ethnic groups, but patterns have often varied across different vaccine programmes.

Added value of this studyOur study describes the sub-groups of the UK population who are more likely to be hesitant about a COVID-19 vaccine and examines possible explanations for this. We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 survey element of the UKs largest household panel study. We asked specifically about vaccine hesitancy in relation to a COVID-19 vaccine at a time when initial results of vaccine trials were being reported in the media. We found willingness to be vaccinated is generally high across the UK population but marked differences exist across population subgroups. Willingness to be vaccinated was greater in older age groups and in men. However, some minority ethnic groups, particularly Black/Black British and Pakistani/Bangladeshi, had high levels of vaccine hesitancy but this was not seen across all minority ethnic groups. People with lower education levels were also more likely to be vaccine hesitant.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe current evidence base on vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 is rapidly emerging but remains limited. Polling data has also found relatively high levels of willingness to take up a COVID-19 vaccine and suggested greater risks of vaccine hesitancy among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people. Our study suggests that the risk of vaccine hesitancy differs across minority ethnic groups considerably, with Black ethnic groups particularly likely to be vaccine hesitant within the UK. Some White minority ethnic groups are also more likely to be vaccine hesitant than White British/Irish people.

Herd immunity may be achievable through vaccination in the UK but a focus on specific ethnic minority and socioeconomic groups is needed to ensure an equitable vaccination programme.",02/01/2021,10.1101/2020.12.27.20248899,Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi,University of Glasgow,medrxiv,0,0,,
144,20591,"The social experience of participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial: Subjects' motivations, others' concerns, and insights for vaccine promotion","BackgroundVaccine hesitancy could undermine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Knowledge about peoples lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake.

AimTo use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process.

MethodsWe interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of peoples lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making.

ResultsParticipants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing ones duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe.

ConclusionThese findings regarding participants reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.",05/01/2021,10.1101/2020.12.30.20249051,Emily Wentzell,University of Iowa,medrxiv,0,0,,
145,20849,Enisamium is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and shows improvement of recovery in COVID-19 patients in an interim analysis of a clinical trial,"Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causes a mild to severe respiratory disease called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Control of SARS-CoV-2 spread will depend on vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity. Until then, antiviral strategies are needed to manage COVID-19, but approved antiviral treatments, such as remdesivir, can only be delivered intravenously. Enisamium (laboratory code FAV00A, trade name Amizon(R)) is an orally active inhibitor of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture and clinically approved in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Here we show that enisamium can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections in NHBE and Caco-2 cells. In vitro, the previously identified enisamium metabolite VR17-04 directly inhibits the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that VR17-04 prevents GTP and UTP incorporation. To confirm enisamiums antiviral properties, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which needed medical care either with or without supplementary oxygen. Patients received either enisamium (500 mg per dose) or placebo for 7 days. A pre-planned interim analysis showed in the subgroup of patients needing supplementary oxygen (n = 77) in the enisamium group a mean recovery time of 11.1 days, compared to 13.9 days for the placebo group (log-rank test; p=0.0259). No significant difference was found for all patients (n = 373) or those only needing medical care (n = 296). These results thus suggest that enisamium is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and that enisamium treatment shortens the time to recovery for COVID-19 patients needing oxygen.

Significance statementSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Although vaccines are now becoming available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, the development of antivirals remains necessary for treating current COVID-19 patients and combating future coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we report that enisamium, which can be administered orally, can prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication and that its metabolite VR17-04 can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in vitro. Moreover, we find that COVID-19 patients requiring supplementary oxygen, recover more quickly than patients treated with a placebo. Enisamium may therefore be an accessible treatment for COVID-19 patients.",21/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.05.21249237,Aartjan Te Velthuis,University of Cambridge,medrxiv,0,0,,
146,20763,Epidemiological differences in the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States and China,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to forecast the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States (US) and China, two countries at different epidemic phases.

MethodsA mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression was used to investigate vaccine impact. Impact was assessed both for a vaccine that prevents infection (VES = 95%) and a vaccine that prevents only disease (VEP = 95%).

ResultsFor VES = 95% and gradual easing of restrictions, vaccination in the US reduced the peak incidence of infection, disease, and death by >55% and cumulative incidence by >32%, and in China by >77% and >65%, respectively. Nearly three vaccinations were needed to avert one infection in the US, but only one was needed in China. For VEP = 95%, benefits of vaccination were half those for VES = 95%. In both countries, the impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up, vaccine coverage >50%, and slower or no easing of restrictions, particularly in the US.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccination can flatten, delay, and/or prevent future epidemic waves. However, vaccine impact is destined to be heterogeneous across countries because of an underlying ""epidemiologic inequity"" that reduces benefits for countries already at high incidence, such as the US. Despite 95% efficacy, actual vaccine impact could be meager in such countries, if vaccine scale-up is slow, acceptance of the vaccine is poor, or restrictions are eased prematurely.

One Sentence SummaryVaccine impact will be heterogeneous across countries disadvantaging countries at high incidence. This heterogeneity can be alleviated with rapid vaccination scale-up and limited easing of restrictions.",08/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.07.21249380,Laith J Abu-Raddad,"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar",medrxiv,0,0,,
147,20739,A two-phase stochastic dynamic model for COVID-19 mid-term policy recommendations in Greece: a pathway towards mass vaccination,"From November 7th, 2020, Greece adopted a second nationwide lockdown policy to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the first took place from March 23rd till May 4th, 2020), just as the second wave of COVID-19 was advancing, as did other European countries. In the light of the very promising voluntary mass vaccination, which will start in January 2021, it is of utmost importance for the country to plan to complement vaccination with mid-term Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). The objective is to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until February 15th, 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from February 15th, 2021 to June 30th, 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed in the first phase: (a) a baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs on January 2021, (b) a ""semi-lockdown"" scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing and social distancing/teleworking on January 2021 and (c) a ""rolling lockdown"" scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third imposed nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some preliminary first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the ""semi-lockdown"" scenario outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities), whereas in the second phase it is of great importance to ensure a sufficient vaccine supply and high vaccination rates.",08/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.07.21249394,Nikolaos P.

148,20807,Factors indicating intention to vaccinate with a COVID-19 vaccine among older U.S. Adults,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSThe success of vaccination efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic will require broad public uptake of immunization and highlights the importance of understanding factors associated with willingness to receive a vaccine.

METHODSAdults enrolled in the Heartline clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the Heartline mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm.

RESULTSAmong 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n=7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report.

CONCLUSIONSEven among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.

In this study we use a network Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to show under which circumstances it is in a countrys self-interest to ensure other countries can also obtain a COVID-19 vaccine rather than focusing only on vaccination of their own residents. In particular, we focus our analysis on the USs decision and estimate the internal burden of COVID-19 disease under different scenarios about vaccine cooperation. We show that in scenarios in which the US has reached the threshold for domestic herd immunity, the US may find it optimal to donate doses to other countries with lower vaccination coverage, as this would allow for a sharp reduction in the inflow of infected individuals from abroad.",14/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.11.21249610,Tiziano Rotesi,University of Lausanne,medrxiv,0,0,,
150,20980,Impact of COVID-19 on Migrants' Access to Primary Care:A National Qualitative Study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable changes in the delivery of primary care in the UK, including rapid digitalisation, yet the extent to which these have impacted on marginalised migrant groups - already facing existing barriers to NHS care - is unknown. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of health professionals and migrants will support initiatives to deliver more effective health services, including delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, to marginalised groups.

AimTo understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants and their access to primary healthcare, and implications for COVID-19 vaccine roll out.

Design and SettingPrimary care professionals, administrative staff, and migrants (foreign born; >18 years; <10 years in UK), were recruited in three phases using purposive, convenience and snowball sampling from urban, suburban and rural settings.

MethodsIn-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis.

Results64 clinicians were recruited in Phase 1 (25 GPs, 15 nurses, 7 HCAs, 1 Pharmacists); Phase 2 comprised administrative staff (11 PMs and 5 receptionists); and in Phase 3 we recruited 17 migrants (88% asylum seekers; 65% female; mean time in UK 4 years). We found that digitalisation and virtual consultations (telephone, video, and online form-based) have amplified existing inequalities in access to healthcare for many migrants due to lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. Use of virtual consultations has resulted in concerns around building trust and the risk of missing safeguarding cues. Participants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing healthcare due to the physical closure of surgeries. Participants reported indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. In addition, migrants reported a range of specific beliefs around COVID-19 and on potential COVID-19 vaccines, from acceptance to mistrust, often influenced by misinformation. PCPs raised concerns that migrants may have increased risk factors for poor general health and to severe illness from COVID-19, in part due to their social and economic situation. Innovative opportunities were suggested to engage migrant groups through translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube which merit further exploration.

ConclusionPandemic-related changes in primary care delivery may be here to stay, and some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. As primary care networks operationalise the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, these findings provide critical information on specific strategies required to support migrant population to access primary care and overcome misinformation around COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine.

How this fits inThe impact of pandemic-related shifts in primary care delivery on marginalised migrant groups, who may already face major disparities in accessing primary care, is poorly elucidated. We found that the rapid digitalisation of primary care services and physical closure of surgeries during the pandemic have amplified disparities in access to healthcare for specific migrant groups, with many lacking access to and capacity to use technology, compounded by language barriers. Migrants may be at increased risk of misinformation about COVID-19, which merits further consideration as COVID-19 vaccine roll out begins. Improved outreach to local migrant community organisations and places of worship, alongside co-designing with migrants more inclusive delivery approaches and creative integration of migrant ambassadors into information-sharing campaigns are needed. Primary care can maximise the opportunities of digitalisation for migrants through flexible engagement by multiple modalities (e.g. text, email, letter and YouTube videos) to provide targeted, translated advice and information, virtual group consultations for patients with a specific condition, and working with local leaders and NGOs to access and disseminate information through informal communication channels.",15/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.12.21249692,Sally Hargreaves,"The Migrant Health Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George\'s, University of London",medrxiv,0,0,,
151,21051,Optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation using real-time seroprevalence estimates in Rhode Island and Massachusetts,"As three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines come to market in Europe and North America in the winter of 2020-2021, distribution networks will be in a race against a major epidemiological wave of SARS-CoV-2 that began in autumn 2020. Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation is critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health-care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with co-morbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression. Here, we evaluate various age-based vaccine distributions using a validated mathematical model based on current epidemic trends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not be included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for current age-specific immune patterns in both states. We find that allocating a substantial proportion (> 75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. As we do not explicitly model other high mortality groups, this result on vaccine allocation applies to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. Our analysis confirms that for an easily transmissible respiratory virus, allocating a large majority of vaccinations to groups with the highest mortality risk is optimal. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020-2021 have equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff. Vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and will result in 1% to 2% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021. Assuming high vaccination coverage (> 28%) and no major relaxations in distancing, masking, gathering size, or hygiene guidelines between now and spring 2021, our model predicts that a combination of vaccination and population immunity will lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.",15/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.12.21249694,Maciej F Boni,"Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA",medrxiv,0,0,,

To evaluate the duration of protection while allowing trial participants timely access to efficacious vaccine, investigators can sequentially cross participants over from the placebo arm to the vaccine arm according to priority groups. Here, we show how to estimate potentially time-varying placebo-controlled VE in this type of staggered vaccination of participants. In addition, we compare the performance of blinded and unblinded crossover designs in estimating long-term VE.

153,21035,Evaluating the effects of re-opening plans on dynamics of COVID-19 in SP,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in early March 2020. In Brazil, Sao Paulo is the most affected state, comprising about 20% of the countrys cases. With no vaccine available to date, distancing measures have been taken to reduce virus transmission. To reduce the pandemics effect on the economy, the government of Sao Paulo has proposed a plan consisting of five phases of the gradual re-opening of activities. In this context, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate the gradual re-opening plan on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, in the city of Sao Paulo. The model shows that a precipitous reopening can cause a higher peak of the disease, which may compromise the local health system. Waiting for the reduction in the incidence of infected individuals for at least 15 days to phase transition is the most efficient strategy compared to the fixed-period scenario at each phase of the re-opening plan.",15/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.14.21249809,Felipe Alves Rubio,University of Campinas,medrxiv,0,0,,
154,21251,"Immunisation, asymptomatic infection, herd immunity and the new variants of COVID-19","ObjectivesIs ""herd immunity"" to COVID-19 a realistic outcome of any immunisation programme with the two main vaccines currently licenced in the UK (Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 and Astra Zeneca/Oxford vaccine ChAdOx1-S)? More formally, can these vaccines achieve a sufficient level of population immunity to reduce R, the reproduction number of the infection, to below one in the absence of any non-pharmaceutical interventions?

DesignThe study uses simple mathematical models of the transmission of COVID-19 infection from primary to secondary cases parameterised using data on virus transmission and vaccine efficacy from the literature and the regulatory approval process for the vaccines.

ResultsIn the regulatory approval documents, the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine is estimated at 0.948 (that for the Moderna vaccine is similar). Efficacy for the Oxford vaccine against primary symptomatic illness is estimated as 0.704, based on pooling of data from two dose regimes. For values of R0 similar to those reported during the first months of the pandemic, the simplest analysis implies that reducing the value of R below 1 would require 69% and 93% of the population to be vaccinated with the Pfizer and Oxford vaccine respectively (or achieve a comparable level of immunity through natural infection). However, the new variant of COVID-19 (Lineage B.1.1.7, named Variant of Concern VOC-202012/01) is reported to have an R-value 1.56 (0.92 to 2.28) times higher than the original strain. Vaccinating the entire population with the Oxford vaccine would only reduce the R value to 1.325 while the Pfizer vaccine would require 82% of the population to be vaccinated to control the spread of the new variant.

The Oxford vaccine reduces the incidence of serious illness to a greater extent than it reduces symptomatic illness. But its efficacy against the incidence of asymptomatic infections is lower, reducing its efficacy against all infection from 0.704 to 0.525 for the pooled data. Although asymptomatics are less infectious, including them in our calculations still raises R values by 20% or more, from 1.33 to 1.6 for the new variant with 100% vaccination. Neither vaccine is licenced for use in children, and when this is taken into account, this R value rises by a further 37% to 2.2 if the whole adult population is vaccinated. Even the more effective mRNA vaccines may allow the pandemic to persist via transmission amongst children, as current authorisations only allow their use on adults. In the absence of vaccination, R will reduce to 1 when 89% of the population has acquired immunity as a result of previous infection with COVID-19.

ConclusionsAll currently licensed vaccines provide substantial protection against serious illness to vaccinated individuals themselves. But the Oxford vaccine appears to have relatively low efficacy against asymptomatic infections. Although no comparable data from human trials are available for the mRNA vaccines, non-human primate studies suggest they are better at preventing nasal shedding and so transmission. Herd immunity to COVID-19 will be very difficult to achieve, especially so for the less effective vaccine. The possibility of transmission from vaccinated but infected individuals to vulnerable unvaccinated individuals is of serious concern.

This study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation.

A total of 2013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being at high-risk for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior two weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior two weeks, being pessimistic on the vaccine, and working in healthcare were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we showed reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction and sleep medication use, and advanced sleep phase, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers ([~]60%) and severe depression ([~]20%) in a context of increased perceived stress.

This study demonstrated a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health. Large-scale interventions to counteract the chronicity and exacerbation of sleep and psychological disturbances are necessary, especially for the risk categories.",20/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.17.21249947,Michele Ferrara,University of L\'Aquila,medrxiv,0,0,,
156,21242,The burden of nosocomial covid-19: results from the Wales multi-centre retrospective observational study of 2518 hospitalised adults.,"ObjectivesTo define the burden of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) novel pandemic coronavirus (covid-19) infection among adults hospitalised across Wales.

DesignRetrospective observational study of adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st March - 1st July 2020 with a recorded hospital admission within the subsequent 31 days. Outcomes were collected up to 20th November using a standardised online data collection tool.

SettingService evaluation performed across 18 secondary or tertiary care hospitals.

Participants4112 admissions with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result between 1st March to 1st July 2020 were screened. Anonymised data from 2518 participants were returned, representing over 60% of adults hospitalised across the nation of Wales.

Main outcome measuresThe prevalence and outcomes (death, discharge) for nosocomial covid-19, assessed across of a range of possible case definitions.

ResultsInpatient mortality rates for nosocomial covid-19 ranged from 38% to 42% and remained consistently higher than participants with community-acquired infection (31% to 35%) across a range of case definitions. Participants with nosocomial-acquired infection were an older, frailer, and multi-morbid population than those with community-acquired infection. Based on the Public Health Wales case definition, 50% of participants had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnostic testing.

ConclusionsThis represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients with nosocomial covid-19 in the UK to date. These findings suggest that inpatient mortality rates from nosocomial-infection are likely higher than previously reported, emphasizing the importance of infection control measures, and supports prioritisation of vaccination for covid-19 negative admissions and trials of post-exposure prophylaxis in inpatient cohorts.

Trial registrationThis project was approved and sponsored by the Welsh Government, as part of a national audit and quality improvement scheme for patients hospitalised covid-19 across Wales.

Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science up until 31-December-2020 for studies reporting on patient outcomes following hospital-acquired infection due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We identified a range of case-definitions for hospital-acquired infection, based on timing of diagnostic testing 5 to 15 days following admission. The largest and only multi-centre study concluded individuals with nosocomial infection are at a lower risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 than those infected in the community, however, was performed early in the pandemic and utilised a conservative definition of nosocomial infection.

What this study addsOur multi-centre observational study represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients with nosocomial covid-19 in the UK to date, and suggests the burden of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection has been underestimated. Nosocomial-infection occurred in older, frailer, and multi-morbid individuals, and was consistently associated with greater inpatient mortality than amongst those who were infected in the community across a spectrum of case-definitions. Our findings support implementation of enhanced infection control measures to reduce this burden during future waves, especially given the recent emergence of novel viral variants with enhanced transmissibility. Furthermore, roughly half of the patients meeting the Public Health Wales definition of definite nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnosis, highlighting a potential window of opportunity for inpatient pre-exposure and/or post-exposure prophylaxis.",19/03/2021,10.1101/2021.01.18.21249433,Simon M Barry,"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board",medrxiv,0,0,,
158,21291,Impact of immediate and preferential relaxation of social and travel restrictions for vaccinated people on the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 : a model-based analysis,"BackgroundFour COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer, Moderna, University of Oxford/ Astra Zeneca (also Oxford/ Serum Institute of India) and ICMR/ Bharat Biotech have been granted emergency use authorization in the democratic world following established clinical trial procedures in their respective countries. Vaccination of the general public is expected to begin in several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately cleared to return to normal activities, including hassle-free travel.

MethodsWe use a delay differential equation model developed previously by our group to calculate the effects of vaccinee ""immunity passports"" on the spreading trajectories of the disease. We consider default virus strains as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 in our analysis.

ResultsWe find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, vaccinees may be immediately cleared for normal life with no significant increase in case counts. Free travel of such vaccinees between two regions should not jeopardize the infection control performance of either. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be eight months or more before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or eliminated. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent however, social as well as travel restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until transmission of the disease is eliminated.

ConclusionsDesigning high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drive with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants if any of efficacy, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death toll and socioeconomic cost.",20/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.19.21250100,B Shayak,Cornell University,medrxiv,0,0,,
159,21279,Modeling the population effects of epitope specific escape mutations in SARS-CoV-2 to guide vaccination strategies,"Escape mutations (EM) to SARS-Cov-2 have been detected and are spreading. Vaccines may need adjustment to respond to these or future mutations. We designed a population level model integrating both waning immunity and EM. We also designed a set of criteria for elaborating and fitting this model to cross-neutralization and other data in a manner that minimizes vaccine decision errors. We formulated four model variations. These define criteria for which prior infections provide immunity that can be escaped. They also specify different sequences where one EM follows another. At all reasonable parameter values, these model variations led to patterns where: 1) EM were rare in the first epidemic, 2) rebound epidemics after the first epidemic were accelerated more by increasing drifting than by increasing waning (with some exceptions), 3) the long term endemic level of infection was determined mostly by waning rates with small effects of the drifting parameter, 4) EM caused loss of vaccine effectiveness and under some conditions, vaccines induced EM that caused higher levels of infection with vaccines than without them. The differences and similarities across the four models suggest paths for developing models specifying the epitopes where EM act. This model is a base on which to construct epitope specific evolutionary models using new high-throughput assay data from population samples to guide vaccine decisions.

HighlightsO_LIThis model is the first to integrate both antigenic drifting from escape mutations and immunity waning in continuous time.
C_LIO_LITiny amounts of only waning or only escape mutation drifting have small or no effects. Together, they have large effects.
C_LIO_LIThere are no or few escape mutations during the first epidemic peak and no effect of drifting parameters on the size of that wave.
C_LIO_LIAfter the first epidemic peak, escape mutations accumulate rapidly. They increase with increases in waning rates and with increases in the drifting rate. Escape mutations then amplify other escape mutations since these raise the frequency of reinfections.
C_LIO_LIEscape mutations can completely negate the effects of vaccines and even lead to more infections with vaccination than without, especially at very low waning rates.
C_LIO_LIThe model generates population level cross-neutralization patterns that enable the model to be fitted to population level serological data.
C_LIO_LIThe model can be modified to use laboratory data that determine the epitope specific effects of mutations on ACE2 attachment strength or escape from antibody effects.
C_LIO_LIThe model, although currently unable to predict the effects of escape mutations in the real world, opens up a path that can guide model incorporation of molecularly studied escape mutations and improve predictive value. We describe that path.
C_LIO_LIModel analysis indicates that vaccine trials and serological surveys are needed now to detect the effects of epitope specific escape mutations that could cause the loss of vaccine efficacy.

160,21319,Simulating the impact of different vaccination policies on the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City,"PurposeTo analyze potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation scenarios and vaccine rollout policies from early Jan 2021 to end of June 2021.

Key findingsIn anticipation of the potential arrival and dominance of the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant:

O_LIMass-vaccination would be critical to mitigating epidemic severity (26-52% reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to no vaccination, provided the new UK variant supplants currently circulating variants).
C_LIO_LIPrioritizing key risk groups for earlier vaccination would lead to greater reductions in hospitalizations and deaths than infections. Thus, in general this would be a good strategy.
C_LIO_LICurrent vaccination prioritization policy is suboptimal. To avert more hospitalizations and deaths, mass-vaccination of all individuals 65 years or older should be done as soon as possible. For groups listed in the same phase, 65+ year-olds should be given first priority ahead of others.
C_LIO_LIAvailable vaccine doses should be given to the next priority groups as soon as possible without awaiting hesitant up-stream groups.
C_LIO_LIWhile efficacy of vaccination off-protocol is unknown, provided immune response following a first vaccine dose persists, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose by [~]1 month (i.e. administer the two doses 8 weeks apart) can substantially reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to the 3-week apart regimen. Across all scenarios tested here, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose leads to the largest reduction in severe epidemic outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and deaths). Therefore, to protect as many people as possible, this strategy should be considered if rapid increases in infections, hospitalization or deaths and/or shortages in vaccines were to occur.

161,21377,An interactive COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker (CovMT) with a particular focus on critical mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of the Spike protein,"Almost one year has passed since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of confirmed SARS-Cov-2 cases worldwide has now reached [~]92 million, with 2 million reported deaths (https://covid19.who.int). Nearly 400,000 SARS-Cov-2 genomes were sequenced from COVID-19 samples and added to public resources such as GISAID (https://gisaid.org). With the vaccines becoming available or entering trials (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org), it is vital to keep track of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the Spike proteins Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region, which could have a potential impact on disease severity and treatment strategies.1-3 In the wake of a recent increase in cases with a potentially more infective RBD mutation (N501Y) in the United Kingdom, countries worldwide are concerned about the spread of this or similar variants. Impressive sampling and timely increase in sequencing efforts related to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) helped detect and monitor the spread of the new N501Y variant.

162,21397,An external validation of the QCovid risk prediction algorithm for risk of mortality from COVID-19 in adults: national validation cohort study in England,"BackgroundTo externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study using the ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort based on the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service Data for pandemic planning and research, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two time periods were used: (a) 24th January to 30th April 2020; and (b) 1st May to 28th July 2020. We evaluated the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration for each validation time period.

FindingsThe study comprises 34,897,648 adults aged 19-100 years resident in England. There were 26,985 COVID-19 deaths during the first time-period and 13,177 during the second. The algorithms had good calibration in the validation cohort in both time periods with close correspondence of observed and predicted risks. They explained 77.1% (95% CI: 76.9% to 77.4%) of the variation in time to death in men in the first time-period (R2); the D statistic was 3.76 (95% CI: 3.73 to 3.79); Harrells C was 0.935 (0.933 to 0.937). Similar results were obtained for women, and in the second time-period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first time period was 65.9% for men and 71.7% for women. People in the top 20% of predicted risks of death accounted for 90.8% of all COVID-19 deaths for men and 93.0% for women.

InterpretationThe QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. It has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPublic policy measures and clinical risk assessment relevant to COVID-19 need to be aided by rigorously developed and validated risk prediction models. A recent living systematic review of published risk prediction models for COVID-19 found most models are subject to a high risk of bias with optimistic reported performance, raising concern that these models may be unreliable when applied in practice. A population-based risk prediction model, QCovid risk prediction algorithm, has recently been developed to identify adults at high risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, which overcome many of the limitations of previous tools.

Added value of this studyCommissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for England, we validated the novel clinical risk prediction model (QCovid) to identify risks of short-term severe outcomes due to COVID-19. We used national linked datasets from general practice, death registry and hospital episode data for a population-representative sample of over 34 million adults. The risk models have excellent discrimination in men and women (Harrells C statistic>0.9) and are well calibrated. QCovid represents a new, evidence-based opportunity for population risk-stratification.

Implications of all the available evidenceQCovid has the potential to support public health policy, from enabling shared decision making between clinicians and patients in relation to health and work risks, to targeted recruitment for clinical trials, and prioritisation of vaccination, for example.",25/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.22.21249968,Vahe Nafilyan,Office for National Statistics,medrxiv,0,0,,
163,21582,Community structured model for vaccine strategies to control COVID19 spread: a mathematical study,"Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",26/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.25.21250505,Huaiping Zhu,York University,medrxiv,0,0,,

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with the novel oral angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist C21 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with C-reactive protein 50-150 mg/L but not needing mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to oral C21 (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days in addition to standard of care, including glucocorticoids and remdesivir.

Results106 patients underwent randomization (51 in the C21 group and 55 in the placebo group). At day 14 after start of treatment, the proportion of patients still requiring supplemental oxygen was significantly reduced by 90% in the C21 group compared to the placebo group (p=0.003). Moreover, fewer patients required mechanical ventilation (one C21 patient and four placebo patients), and C21 was associated with a numerical reduction in the mortality rate (one and three deaths in the C21 and placebo group, respectively). Treatment with C21 was safe and well tolerated.

ConclusionsAs studied in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, C21 on top of standard of care led to a clinically beneficial improvement in respiratory function compared to placebo, paving the way for a pivotal randomised controlled trial.

167,21693,Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose,"Two of the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States require two doses, administered three to four weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% CrI: 7.8 - 29.7) infections, 0.71 (95% CrI: 0.52 - 0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25 - 0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the two doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.61 (95% CrI: 0.37 - 0.89) hospitalizations and 0.31 (95% CrI: 0.23 - 0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the two doses.",26/03/2021,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250619,Seyed M.

169,21947,Vaccinating Australia: How long will it take?,"The Australian Governments COVID-19 vaccine rollout strategy is scheduled to commence in late February 2021 and aims to vaccinate the Australian adult population by the end of October 2021. The task of vaccinating some 20 million people within this timeframe presents considerable logistical challenges. Key to meeting this target is the rate of vaccine delivery: the number of vaccine doses that can be administered per day. In the opening phase, high priority groups will receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through hospital hubs at an initial rate of 80,000 doses per week. However, pending regulatory approval, the currently announced plan appears to be to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine to the bulk of the popluation through a combination of general practices and community pharmacies. Here, we run a series of projections to estimate how long it will take to vaccinate the Australian population under different assumptions about the rate of vaccine administration as well as the schedule for second doses and prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis highlights the ambitious rate of vaccine administration that will be neccessary to meet the Australian Government completion target of October 2021. A rate of 200,000 doses per day would comfortably meet that target; 80,000 doses a day would see roll-out extended until mid-2022. Speed is of the essence when it comes to vaccine rollout: protecting the population quickly will minimise the risk of sporadic and costly lockdowns lockdowns and the potential for small, local clusters getting out of control and sparking new epidemic waves. The government should gather all its resources to maximise the daily vaccination rate, ideally aiming to ramp up administration to at least 200,000 doses per day as quickly as possible. Quickly achieving and maintaining this pace will likely require dedicated large-scale vaccination sites that are capable of delivering thousands of doses a week in addition to the enthusiastic participation of GP practices and community pharmacies around the country. Lessons on the neccessary logistical planning, including coordination of delivery, ultra-cold-chain storage and staffing, can potentially be learned from Israel, where between 7,000 and 20,000 vaccinations per million population have been delivered daily throughout January.",04/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.02.21250979,Mark J Hanly,UNSW Australia,medrxiv,0,0,,

ObjectiveTo systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as potential treatment for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBased on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data, drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on COVID-19 disease outcomes.

ExposuresPatient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in structured format.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause of death was selected as primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes.

ResultsThe study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized, 82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%) died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids), methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and fluticasone.

171,22260,Robust immune responses after one dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2 experienced individuals,"The use of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. COVID-19 vaccine candidates have resulted in robust humoral responses and protective efficacy in human trials, but efficacy trials excluded individuals with prior diagnosis of COVID-19. As a result, little is known about how immune responses induced by mRNA vaccine candidates differ in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated longitudinal immune responses to two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in 13 adults who recovered from COVID-19, compared to 19 adults who did not have prior COVID-19 diagnosis. Consistent with prior studies of mRNA vaccines, we observed robust cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses in both cohorts. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals had progressive increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. Together, these data highlight the relevance of immunological history for understanding vaccine immune responses and may have significant implications for personalizing mRNA vaccination regimens used to prevent COVID-19.

However, many countries have yet to implement this because of financial or logistical barriers to delivering two doses outside the infant immunisation programme.

MethodsUsing three independent HPV transmission models, we estimated the long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness of one-dose versus two-dose HPV vaccination, in 192 countries, assuming that one dose of the vaccine gives either a shorter duration of full protection (20 or 30 years) or lifelong protection but lower vaccine efficacy (e.g., 80%) compared to two doses. We simulated routine vaccination with the 9-valent HPV vaccine in 10-year-old girls at 80% coverage for the years 2021-2120, with a one-year catch-up of 80% 11-14-year-old girls on the first year of the programme.

FindingsOver the next century, one-dose vaccination at 80% coverage could avert 64 million (80%UI 62{middle dot}2-64{middle dot}8) and 66{middle dot}6 million (80%UI 63{middle dot}4-69{middle dot}1) cervical cancer cases should one dose of the vaccine confer 20 and 30 years of protection, respectively. Should one dose of the vaccine provide lifelong protection at 80% vaccine efficacy, 68{middle dot}4 million (80%UI 63{middle dot}8-69{middle dot}4) cervical cancer cases could be prevented. Across all country income groups, two-dose schedules conferring lifelong protection would avert only slightly more cases (2{middle dot}1-8{middle dot}7 million) than the one-dose scenarios explored. Around 330 to 5230 additional girls need to be vaccinated with the second dose to prevent one cervical cancer case, depending on the epidemiological profiles of the country.

InterpretationResults were consistent across the three independent models and suggest that one-dose vaccination has similar health benefits to a two-dose programme while simplifying vaccine delivery, reducing costs and alleviating vaccine supply constraints.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrimary prevention of cervical cancer is now available with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Initially administered as a three-dose regimen, the HPV vaccine schedule recommended by WHO has now switched to two doses for individuals below the age of 15 years. Although WHO recommends all countries to routinely immunise adolescent girls with two doses, many low- and middle-income countries, with high disease burden, have yet to implement national HPV vaccination programmes because of the challenges of delivering two vaccine doses to adolescent females. Recently, HPV vaccine implementation in many countries has been further delayed due to constraints in vaccine supply and difficulties in access during COVID-19 epidemics. These financial, logistical, and supply constraints have motivated research into one-dose vaccination schedules. Evidence emerging from trials and observational studies suggests that one dose may also provide a high level of protection against incident and persistent HPV infections. If proven effective, the one-dose HPV vaccination schedule would simplify vaccine delivery and lower costs of national vaccination programmes, potentially enabling more countries to implement one and as a result, facilitating global cervical cancer prevention. We searched PubMed for trials, cohort and modelling studies published in 2018 and 2020, with the terms ""(health impact OR impact OR modelling OR cost-effectiveness OR CEA OR durability OR effectiveness) AND (HPV OR human papillomavirus OR cervical cancer)"" and identified 151 results. Ten published articles--four trials, three cohort studies, two modelling analyses, one systematic review of trials--evaluated the population impact of one dose of the vaccine on cervical cancer disease outcome among females and all studies showed one dose of the vaccine might be as effective as two doses in preventing HPV infection. However as the trials and cohorts were single-country studies in select populations, the global impact remains unknown. Both published modelling analyses only used one model to estimate the impact of one-dose vaccination, and only examined a few countries. To our knowledge, no published article has modelled the global impact of routine one-dose vaccination on cervical cancer prevention by synthesising the results from more than one model.

Added value of this studyThis study presents the first evidence on the potential global impact of a routine one-dose regimen, from a comparative modelling analysis that synthesises results from three published dynamic models calibrated to countries with varying epidemiological and demographic profiles. We found consistent results across all models suggesting that routine one-dose vaccination provides the majority of health benefits to the two-dose programme should a single dose of the vaccine confer more than 20 years of protection at full potential efficacy or 80% efficacy with lifelong protection.

Implications of all the available evidenceFindings suggest that routine one-dose vaccinations could avert almost as many cervical cancer cases as a two-dose programme. The one-dose regimen would be cheaper and easier to implement for most countries while alleviating vaccine supply constraints. To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have had to implement stringent physical distancing measures, which has led to the suspension of routine immunisation programmes. Public health authorities grapple with the logistic challenges of delivering immunisation services while minimising the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Compared to the two-dose vaccination schedule, a one-dose vaccination schedule would reduce interactions between vaccinees and health workers, simplifying vaccine delivery while also decreasing SARS-CoV-2 exposure.",08/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.08.21251186,Kiesha Prem,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,medrxiv,0,0,,
173,22386,The global distribution of COVID-19 vaccine: The role of macro-socioeconomics measures,"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has continued to spread globally, many countries have progressed clinical trials and started vaccinations at the end of December 2020. This report aims to analyze the association of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and two macro-socioeconomics measures, including human development index (HDI) and Gross domestic product (GDP), among 25 countries till the first week of February 2021. Our results indicate that a higher GDP per Capita is positively associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine distribution. However, UAE and Israel have more successful vaccine distribution outcomes regardless of their GDP. In addition, the result shows HDI does not have a significant relationship with vaccine distribution. Although these macro-socioeconomic measures may be counted as a vital indicator for vaccine distribution, other factors may play roles in vaccine distribution, including well-developed health infrastructure, a centralized political system, and population size.",15/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.09.21251436,Ali Roghani,University of Utah,medrxiv,0,0,,
174,22383,'Leading from the front implementation strategies increase the success of influenza vaccination drives among healthcare workers: A reanalysis of Systematic Review evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA),"BackgroundSeasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is widely recommended to protect staff and patients. A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that  substantial heterogeneity remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity.

MethodsWe used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically analyse associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions.

ResultsIn Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of  leading from the front rather than  top-down implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions  dont-go-in-cold with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. Reapplying the  leading from the front theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns.

ConclusionsRegardless of intervention type a  leading from the front approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success. While the results pertain to flu vaccination among HCWs, the components identified here may be relevant to public health campaigns regarding COVID-19 vaccination.",15/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.10.21251475,Katy Sutcliffe,"EPPI-Centre, Social Research Institute, University College London",medrxiv,0,0,,
175,22590,'Trained immunity' from Mycobacterium spp. (environmental or BCG) exposure predicts protection from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Endeavors to identify protective variables that could be potentially responsible for reduced COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within the first 5 years of life while most of the COVID-19 cases as well as deaths have been observed in adults especially the aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed desired protection being investigated could come from heterologous  trained immunity conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. (i.e., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of  trained immunity of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) of populations would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four) as well as erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher trained immunity prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower trained immunity prevalence neighbors. The incidences, mortality, and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) of COVID-19 are found negatively correlated with the trained immunity of populations that have comparable underlying confounders not the BCG coverage per se. It is submitted that to decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit that can be gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of trained immunity as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b) small study groups of higher background trained immunity could fail to indicate any protective effect.",19/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.11.20233593,Samer Singh,Banaras Hindu University,medrxiv,0,0,,
176,22530,FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective per real-world evidence synthesized across a multi-state health system,"Large Phase 3 clinical trials of the two FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), have demonstrated efficacies of 94.1% (n = 30,420, 95% CI: 89.3-96.8) and 95% (n = 43,448, 95% CI: 90.3-97.6) in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, respectively.

Our retrospective analysis contrasts 31,069 individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who are propensity-matched based on demographics, location (zip code), and number of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and were at risk for infection at least 36 days after their first dose. Administration of two COVID-19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. Furthermore, vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than propensity-matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk: 0.4; p-value: 0.007). Building upon the previous randomized trials of these vaccines, this study demonstrates their real-world effectiveness in reducing the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity among individuals at highest risk for infection.",27/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.15.21251623,Venky Soundararajan,nference,medrxiv,0,0,,
177,22799,"Phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination: rapid assessment of policy adoption, reach and effectiveness to protect the most vulnerable in the US","ObjectivesThe US and rest of the world have suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year. The high transmissibility and severity of this virus have provoked governments to adopt a variety of mitigation strategies. Some of these previous measures, such as social distancing and mask mandates, were effective in reducing the case growth rate yet became economically and administratively difficult to enforce as the pandemic continued. In late December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines were first approved in the US and states began a phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is limited quantitative evidence regarding the effectiveness of the phased COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to provide a rapid assessment of the adoption, reach, and effectiveness of the phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsWe utilize an event-study analysis to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the state-level, daily COVID-19 case growth rate.

ResultsThrough this analysis, we assert that vaccination is effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 shortly after the first shots were given. Specifically, the case growth rate declined by 0.124, 0.347, 0.345, 0.464, 0.490, and 0.756 percentage points corresponding to the 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, and 26 or more day periods after the initial shots.

ConclusionsThe findings could be insightful for policymakers as they work to optimize vaccine distribution in later phases, and also for the public as the COVID-19 related health risk is a contentious issue.",23/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.19.21252118,Chaowei Yang,George Mason University,medrxiv,0,0,,
179,22952,Early Antibody Responses Associated with Survival in COVID19 Patients,"Neutralizing antibodies to the SARS CoV-2 spike proteins have been issued Emergency Use Authorizations and are a likely mechanism of vaccines to prevent COVID-19. However, benefit of treatment with monoclonal antibodies has only been observed in clinical trials in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 but not in patients who are hospitalized and/or have advanced disease. To address this observation, we evaluated the timing of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody production in hospitalized patients with the use of a highly sensitive multiplexed bead-based immunoassay allowing for early detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We found that significantly lower levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the first week after symptom onset were associated with patients who expired as compared to patients who were discharged. We also developed a model, based on antibody level trajectory, to predict COVID 19 outcome that is compatible with greater antibody benefit earlier in COVID 19 disease.

Author SummaryWe evaluated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 over time in patients that were hospitalized with COVID 19. Early detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was associated with survival in patients hospitalized with COVID 19. Early antibody levels predicted outcome in our study.

181,22810,COVID-19 Spreading dynamics in an age-structured population with selective relaxation of restrictions for vaccinated individuals : a mathematical modeling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccination of healthcare and other essential workers is underway in many countries while immunization of the general public is expected to begin in the next several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately permitted to return to normal activities.

MethodsWe use a delay differential equation model to calculate the effects of vaccinee ""immunity passports"" on the epidemic spreading trajectories. The model incorporates age-structuring to account for children who are ineligible for vaccination, and senior citizens who are especially vulnerable to the disease. We consider consensus strains of virus as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 and B1.351 in our analysis.

ResultsWe find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, unrestricted vaccinee--vaccinee interactions do not derail the epidemic from a path towards elimination. Vaccinee--non-vaccinee interactions should however be treated with far more caution. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be the better part of a year before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or ceased. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent, restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until the elimination of the disease is achieved. In all cases, the death tolls can be reduced by vaccinating the vulnerable population first.

ConclusionsDesigning high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drives with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants of efficacy, if any, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive augmented with selective relaxations for vaccinees will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death tolls and socio-economic cost.",23/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.22.21252241,B Shayak,Cornell University,medrxiv,0,0,,

However, in the context of a pandemic, the time to generation of protective immunity, the need for and timing of a second vaccination are matters of legitimate debate. This manuscript explores the efficacy and timing of the second dose COVID-19 vaccines, including a reanalysis of data from the Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine phase 3 study.

Methods and findingsA non-weighted three-segment, two knot linear regression was fitted to the published cumulative infection incidence from the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine Phase III trial using the lspine routine in R. The optimal knot days were estimated through sensitivity analysis and the confidence limits for efficacy estimates were determined by Monte Carlo Simulations. This analysis showed the vaccine was effective from day 11 post first vaccination. The estimated efficacy over the period 11 to 28 days post first vaccination was 0.94 and there was no detectable increase in efficacy following the second vaccination. The efficacy post first vaccination substantially preceded the development of detectable serum neutralizing antibody.

ConclusionsStrongly protective immunity develops rapidly following a single vaccination and at least in the short period covered by the timetable of the Phase III trial, there was no additional benefit from a second vaccination. This increases options for use of this vaccine, e.g., for ring fence vaccination, for use in travelers and for mass vaccination rollout.

ObjectivesTo examine the risk factors for in-hospital mortality and describe the effectiveness of different treatment strategies in a real-life setting of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia.

DesignReal-life single-center study during the Lombardy COVID-19 outbreak.

SettingValduce Hospital in Como, Lombardy Region, Italy.

Participants205 laboratory-confirmed patients presenting with SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia requiring hospitalization.

InterventionsAll patients received best supportive care and, based on their clinical needs and comorbidities, specific interventions that included the main drugs being tested for repurposing to treat COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, anticoagulation, antiviral drugs, steroids or interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors.

Main outcomes and measuresClinical, laboratory and treatment characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to explore their impact on in-hospital mortality and compared with current literature data.

ResultsUnivariate analyses for clinical variables showed prognostic significance for age equal or greater than 70 years (estimated 28-days survival: 21.4 vs 67.4%; p<0.0001), presence of 2 or more relevant comorbidities (35.3 vs 61.8%; p=0.0008), ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F) less than 200 at presentation (21-days survival: 14.7 vs 52.4%;p<0.0001), high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (26.4 vs 65.3%; p=0.0001), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) values (25.4 vs 74.9%; p=0.0001), while no statistical significance was found for all the other clinical variables tested. At univariate analysis for the different treatment scheduled, prognostic significance for survival was showed for intermediate or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (estimated 28-days survival: 37.1 vs 23.4%; p=0.0001), hydroxychloroquine (35.7 vs 27.3%; p=0.0029), early antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (60.1 vs 22.4%; p<0.0001), late short-course of steroids (47.9 vs 18.2%; p<0.0001) or tocilizumab therapy (69.4 vs 29.4%; p=0.0059). Multivariable regression confirmed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age older than 70 years (odds ratio 3.26, 95% CI 1.81-5.86; p<0.0001) and showed a reduction in mortality for patients treated with anticoagulant (-0.37, 0.49-0.95; p=0.0273), antiviral (-1.22, 0.16-0.54; p<0.0001), or steroids (-0.59, 0.35-0.87; p=0.0117) therapy.

Conclusions and RelevanceResults from this real-life single-center experience are in agreement and confirm actual literature data on SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, both in terms of clinical risk factors for in-hospital mortality and as regards the effectiveness of the different therapies proposed for the management of COVID-19 disease. Waiting the results from randomized clinical trials, these data could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage and guide the choice between the different treatments implied in COVID-19 disease.

In the initial phase of population-based vaccination in the United States (U.S.) and United Kingdom (U.K.), vaccine hesitancy and limited access may result in disparities in uptake.

MethodsWe performed a cohort study among U.S. and U.K. participants in the smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study (March 24, 2020-February 16, 2021). We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (unsure/not willing) and receipt.

ResultsIn the U.S. (n=87,388), compared to White non-Hispanic participants, the multivariable ORs of vaccine hesitancy were 3.15 (95% CI: 2.86 to 3.47) for Black participants, 1.42 (1.28 to 1.58) for Hispanic participants, 1.34 (1.18 to 1.52) for Asian participants, and 2.02 (1.70 to 2.39) for participants reporting more than one race/other. In the U.K. (n=1,254,294), racial and ethnic minorities had similarly elevated hesitancy: compared to White participants, their corresponding ORs were 2.84 (95% CI: 2.69 to 2.99) for Black participants, 1.66 (1.57 to 1.76) for South Asian participants, 1.84 (1.70 to 1.98) for Middle East/East Asian participants, and 1.48 (1.39 to 1.57) for participants reporting more than one race/other. Among U.S. participants, the OR of vaccine receipt was 0.71 (0.64 to 0.79) for Black participants, a disparity that persisted among individuals who specifically endorsed a willingness to obtain a vaccine. In contrast, disparities in uptake were not observed in the U.K.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was greater among racial and ethnic minorities, and Black participants living in the U.S. were less likely to receive a vaccine than White participants. Lower uptake among Black participants in the U.S. during the initial vaccine rollout is attributable to both hesitancy and disparities in access.",28/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.25.21252402,Andrew T.

186,23015,Interpreting vaccine efficacy trial results for infection and transmission,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high efficacy of multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), and recent studies have shown the vaccines are also effective against infection. Evidence for the effect of each of these vaccines on ability to transmit the virus is also beginning to emerge. We describe an approach to estimate these vaccines effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which under the reasonable assumption that vaccinated individuals who become infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated individuals forms a lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the primary outcome) and cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of carriage for vaccine vs. placebo provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against viral positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations that likely departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this estimate. Applying this approach to published data from the RCT of the Moderna vaccine, we estimate that one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more. We describe how these approaches can be translated into observational studies of vaccine effectiveness.

HighlightsO_LISARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials did not directly estimate vaccine efficacy against transmission.

189,23078,Mathematical modeling to inform vaccination strategies and testing approaches for COVID-19 in nursing homes,"BackgroundNursing home residents and staff were included in the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Because the primary trial endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic disease, there are limited data on the extent to which vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ability to infect others (infectiousness). Assumptions about VE against infection and infectiousness have implications for possible changes to infection prevention guidance for vaccinated populations, including testing strategies.

MethodsWe use a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of a nursing home to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We model three scenarios, varying VE against infection, infectiousness, and symptoms, to understand the expected impact of vaccination in nursing homes, increasing staff vaccination coverage, and different screening testing strategies under each scenario.

ResultsIncreasing vaccination coverage in staff decreases total symptomatic cases in each scenario. When there is low VE against infection and infectiousness, increasing staff coverage reduces symptomatic cases among residents. If vaccination only protects against symptoms, but asymptomatic cases remain infectious, increased staff coverage increases symptomatic cases among residents through exposure to asymptomatic but infected staff. High frequency testing is needed to reduce total symptomatic cases if the vaccine has low efficacy against infection and infectiousness, or only protects against symptoms.

ConclusionsEncouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness.

SummaryThe extent of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against infection, infectiousness, or disease, impacts strategies for vaccination and testing in nursing homes. If vaccines confer some protection against infection or infectiousness, encouraging vaccination in staff may reduce symptomatic cases in residents.",01/03/2021,10.1101/2021.02.26.21252483,Rebecca Kahn,Harvard T.H.

190,23222,Recent changes in COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Healthcare Workers,"IntroductionEarly COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates suggest that up to one-third of HCWs may be vaccine-hesitant. However, it is unclear whether hesitancy among HCWs has improved with time and if there are temporal changes whether these differ by healthcare worker role.

MethodsIn October 2020, a brief survey was sent to all participants in the Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes (HERO) Registry with a yes/no question regarding vaccination under emergency use authorization (EUA): ""If an FDA emergency use-approved vaccine to prevent coronavirus/COVID-19 was available right now at no cost, would you agree to be vaccinated?"" The poll was repeated in December 2020, with the same question sent to all registry participants. Willingness was defined as a ""Yes"" response, and hesitancy was defined as a ""No"" response. Participants were stratified into clinical care roles. Baseline demographics of survey respondents at each timepoint were compared using appropriate univariate statistics (chi-squared and t-tests). Analyses were descriptive, with frequencies and percentages reported for each category.

ResultsOf 4882 HERO active registry participants during September 1 - October 31, 2020, 2070 (42.4%) completed the October survey, and n=1541 (31.6%) completed the December survey. 70.2% and 67.7% who were in clinical care roles, respectively. In October, 54.2% of HCWs in clinical roles said they would take an EUA-approved vaccine, which increased to 76.2% in December. The largest gain in vaccine willingness was observed among physicians, 64.0% of whom said they would take a vaccine in October, compared with 90.5% in December. Nurses were the least likely to report that they would take a vaccine in both October (46.6%) and December (66.9%). We saw no statistically significant differences in age, race/ethnicity, gender, or medical role between time points. When restricting to the 998 participants who participated at both time points, 69% were vaccine-willing at both time points; 15% were hesitant at both time points, 13% who were hesitant in October were willing in December; and 2.9% who were willing in October were hesitant in December.

ConclusionsIn a set of cross-sectional surveys of vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers, willingness improved substantially over 2 calendar months during which the US had a presidential election and two vaccine manufacturers released top-line Phase 3 trial results. While improved willingness was observed in all role categories, nurses reported the most vaccine hesitancy at both time points.",03/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.01.21252457,Emily C Obrien,Duke University,medrxiv,0,0,,
191,23205,High Initial Titres of Anti-Spike Antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 Infection is Associated with Faster Decay Rates at Four Months Follow-Up,"BackgroundDynamics of humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens following infection suggests an initial decay of antibody followed by subsequent stabilization. We aim to understand the longitudinal humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) protein and to evaluate their correlation to clinical symptoms among healthcare workers (HCW).

MethodsIn this cross-sectional longitudinal cohort study done in two phases over four months, HCW underwent serial qualitative serology testing for anti-N antibody, quantitative MSH-ELISA to detect Receptor Binding Domain and full-length S reactive antibodies and completed online surveys about COVID-19 related symptoms and healthcare/community exposure.

ResultsAnti-N antibody positivity was 27% and anti-S positivity was 28% in Phase 1. In Phase 2 anti-S titres were higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic positive subjects in Phase 1. Marginally higher titers were seen in asymptomatic compared to the symptomatic positive subgroup in Phase 2. A positive correlation was noted between age, number and duration of symptoms, and Phase 1 anti-S antibody titre. A strong correlation was observed between Phase 1 titers and decay of anti-S antibody titres between the two phases. Significant correlation with rate of decay was also noted with fever, GI symptoms, and total number and duration of COVID-19 symptoms.

ConclusionsHigher initial anti-S antibody titres were associated with larger number and longer duration of symptoms as well as faster decay during the two time points.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the decay rate of neutralizing antibodies among SARS-CoV-2 infected healthcare workers?

FindingsIn this cohort study that included 178 healthcare workers, over a 4-month period following the COVID-19 pandemic, participants had an initial rise in anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike (S) antibodies, which was followed by decay and stabilization of the titres. Significant correlation with rate of decay was noted with the symptomatic participants.

MeaningA strong correlation is observed in the decay of anti-S antibody titres based on symptomology, thus eluding to the fact that continued recommendations for infection protection and COVID-19 vaccine campaigns are necessary.",02/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.02.21252362,Vidya Menon,NYC H+H/Lincoln,medrxiv,0,0,,
192,23382,Longitudinal Analysis Reveals Distinct Antibody and Memory B Cell Responses in SARS-CoV2 Naive and Recovered Individuals Following mRNA Vaccination,"Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have been authorized for emergency use and are currently being administered to millions of individuals worldwide. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with a prior SARS-CoV2 infection compared to SARS-CoV2 naive subjects. Moreover, how mRNA vaccines impact the development of antibodies as well as memory B cells in COVID-19 experienced versus COVID-19 naive subjects remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated antibody responses and antigen-specific memory B cell responses over time in 33 SARS-CoV2 naive and 11 SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects. mRNA vaccination induced significant antibody and memory B cell responses against full-length SARS-CoV2 spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV2 naive individuals benefitted from both doses of mRNA vaccine with additional increases in antibodies and memory B cells following booster immunization. In contrast, SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had a significant immune response after the first dose with no increase in circulating antibodies or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. Moreover, the magnitude of the memory B cell response induced by vaccination was lower in older individuals, revealing an age-dependence to mRNA vaccine-induced B cell memory. Side effects also tended to associate with post-boost antibody levels, but not with post-boost memory B cells, suggesting that side effect severity may be a surrogate of short-term antibody responses. The frequency of pre-vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals strongly correlated with post-vaccine antibody levels, supporting a key role for memory B cells in humoral recall responses to SARS-CoV2. This observation may have relevance for future booster vaccines and for responses to viral variants that partially escape pre-existing antibodies and require new humoral responses to be generated from memory B cells. Finally, post-boost antibody levels were not correlated with post-boost memory responses in SARS-CoV2 naive individuals, indicating that short-term antibody levels and memory B cells are complementary immunological endpoints that should be examined in tandem when evaluating vaccine response. Together, our data provide evidence of both serological response and immunological memory following mRNA vaccination that is distinct based on prior SARS-CoV2 exposure. These findings may inform vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.

However, no pregnant or lactating individuals were included in the Phase 3 clinical trials of these vaccines despite belonging to a group at high risk for severe complications of COVID-19 infection. We show here that the mRNA from anti-COVID BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines is not detected in human breast milk samples collected 4-48 hours post-vaccine. These results strengthen the recommendation of ABM and WHO that lactating individuals who receive the anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccine should continue to breastfeed their infants uninterrupted.",08/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.05.21252998,Stephanie L Gaw,"University of California, San Francisco",medrxiv,0,0,,
194,23520,"Low Dose Regimens of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Exceed SARS-Cov-2 Correlate of Protection Estimates for Symptomatic Infection, in those 19-55 Years of Age","BackgroundAn exact correlate of protection (CoP) is not yet known for symptomatic COVID-19. However, it is still possible to show a new vaccine regimen exceeds an unknown CoP, provided the regimen shows an equivalent or greater immunological response in all measured indicators relative to the immunological response elicited by a clinically proven vaccine regimen. The principle of comparing immunogenicity between regimens is what the FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium use to authorize modifications to the vaccines for VOC, without requiring clinical efficacy studies before implementation. It is logical to apply the same principle to modifying vaccine doses if the data is available to do so. A two dose 30ug regimen of BNT162b2 has strong clinical evidence of efficacy, as does a single dose 30 ug regimen. The immunological markers for these regimens have been profiled in detail in Phase 1 and 2 trial data.

MethodsThe immunological profile (including binding antibodies, viral neutralization, cytokine profiles, and CD4 and 8 expansion) of the 2 dose 30ug BNT162b2 vaccine is examined, referred to as a highly conservative CoP estimate. The single dose 30 ug BNT162b2 immunological profile is also examined, a tenable CoP estimate. Data from the phase 1 and 2 trials are examined to see if alternate regimens meet or exceed the level of each immune marker measured, relative to the regimens listed above that have proven clinical efficacy.

ResultsFor adults aged 19-55, a 2 dose 10ug BNT162b2 regimen elicits a comparable response to the standard 30 ug dose for each immune indicator, with viral neutralization nearly an order of magnitude greater than the tenable CoP estimate. Similarly, a single dose 10ug BNT 162b2 regimen or a two dose 1ug BNT 162b2 regimen equals or exceeds the immunogenicity of a single 30 ug dose.

ConclusionIf it is reasonable for the FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium to approve vaccine modifications without a clinical trial based on immunogenicity data, three alternate low dose regimens were identified that meet the requirements of having comparable immunogenicity relative to a protocol that has proven clinical efficacy. Immediate implementation of these lower dose regimens should be considered as they have major implications in alleviating vaccine supply, as well as improving vaccine side effect profile, and lowering total cost of vaccination.",11/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.06.21253058,Graham Jurgens,Unaffiliated,medrxiv,0,0,,
195,23535,A Comparative Analysis of Clinical Stage 3 COVID-19 Vaccines using Knowledge Representation,"The emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus at the end of 2019 and its accelerated spread worldwide to become a pandemic has had, from the medical biotechnology point of view, an unprecedented global response, to the point that there are currently 176 vaccine candidates in preclinical stage, 66 in clinical stage, of which 19 are in phase 3, and 5 of these are massively applied worldwide. The purpose of the present work is to elaborate a hierarchical landscape of the current status of phase 3 vaccines, taking into account their attributes of technological platform, safety and efficacy. The methodology used was that of conceptual knowledge representation, resulting in, firstly, an appropriate classification of stage 3 vaccines, The Conceptual Lattice for COVID-19 vaccines, constructed according to how they relate to each other with respect to the set of their attributes. Secondly, the approach used allows proposing rational strategies for the design of heterologous vaccination schemes, which are urgently needed to control the pandemic.",09/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.07.21253082,Javier Dario Burgos-Salcedo,CIINAS CORPORATION,medrxiv,0,0,,
197,23601,Functional Antibodies in COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma,"In the absence of an effective vaccine or monoclonal therapeutic, transfer of convalescent plasma (CCP) was proposed early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as an easily accessible therapy. However, despite the global excitement around this historically valuable therapeutic approach, results from CCP trials have been mixed and highly debated. Unlike other therapeutic interventions, CCP represents a heterogeneous drug. Each CCP unit is unique and collected from an individual recovered COVID-19 patient, making the interpretation of therapeutic benefit more complicated. While the prevailing view in the field would suggest that it is administration of neutralizing antibodies via CCP that centrally provides therapeutic benefit to newly infected COVID-19 patients, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients already possess neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of antibodies can extend far beyond their simple ability to bind and block infection, especially related to their ability to interact with the innate immune system. In our work we deeply profiled the SARS-CoV-2-specific Fc-response in CCP donors, along with the recipients prior to and after CCP transfer, revealing striking SARS-CoV-2 specific Fc-heterogeneity across CCP units and their recipients. However, CCP units possessed more functional antibodies than acute COVID-19 patients, that shaped the evolution of COVID-19 patient humoral profiles via distinct immunomodulatory effects that varied by pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG titers in the patients. Our analysis identified surprising influence of both S and Nucleocapsid (N) specific antibody functions not only in direct antiviral activity but also in anti-inflammatory effects. These findings offer insights for more comprehensive interpretation of correlates of immunity in ongoing large scale CCP trials and for the design of next generation therapeutic design.",11/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.08.21253157,Galit Alter,"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard",medrxiv,0,0,,
198,23703,An Extended COVID-19 Epidemiological Model with Vaccination and Multiple Interventions for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK,"For controlling the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a plethora of hypothetical COVID-19 models has been developed for simulating how diseases spread under different non-pharmaceutical interventions like suppression and mitigation and providing useful guidance to UK policymakers. While many models demonstrate their effectiveness on predicting and controlling the spread of COVID-19, they rarely consider consequence of incorporating the effects of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants and implementing vaccine interventions in large-scale. By December 2020, the second wave in the UK appeared to be much more aggressive with many more cases as one potentially more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant was detected in the UK since September 2020. Meanwhile, UK has begun their first mass vaccination campaign on 8 December 2020, where three vaccines were in use including Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna. Thus, these new issues pose an emergent need to build up advanced models for accessing effectiveness of taking both vaccination and multiple interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks and balancing healthcare demands. Targeting at this problem, we conducted a feasibility study by defining a new mathematical model SEMCVRD (Susceptible [S], Exposed [E] (infected but asymptomatic), Mild [M] and Critical [C] (mild cases, severe and critical cases), [V] (vaccinated), Recovered [R] and Deceased [D]), containing two importantly new features: the combined infection of the mutant strain and the original strain and the addition of a new group who have been vaccinated. The model was fitted and evaluated with a public COVID-19 dataset including daily new infections, new deaths and daily vaccination in the UK from February 2020 to February 2021. Based on the simulation results, 1) we find under the assumption that the vaccine is equivalently effective against both the original strain and new variants of COVID-19, if the UK government implements insensitive suppression intervention for 13 weeks, COVID-19 epidemic will be controlled by the first week of April 2021 and nearly ended by the first week of May 2021. It shows that taking both vaccine and suppression interventions can effectively inhibit the spread and infection of the new mutant virus. 2) we suggest implementing a 3-weeks phased and progressive lifting intervention strategy up to a low intensity mitigation level for effectively controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. By implementing this strategy, the total number of infections in the UK will be limited to 4.2 million and the total number of deaths in the UK is 135 thousand, by the end of June 2021. The epidemic will nearly end in the early of June 2021, and the UK will not experience a shortage of medical resources. 3) On the assumption that UK has a capability of providing 600 thousand vaccinations every day, a 3-weeks phased and progressive lifting intervention strategy up to a moderate intensity mitigation level can end the epidemic by the end of May 2021. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.",15/04/2021,10.1101/2021.03.10.21252748,Po Yang,The University of Sheffield,medrxiv,0,0,,
199,23716,Disulfiram associated with lower risk of Covid-19: a retrospective cohort study,"In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is a substantial need for effective, low-cost therapeutics. We investigated the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in an observational study in a large database of US Veterans Administration clinical records, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). The study is motivated by the unique properties of disulfiram, which has been used as an anti-alcoholism drug since 1948, is non-toxic, easy to manufacture and inexpensive. Disulfiram reduces hyperinflammation in mammalian cells by inhibition of the gasdermin D pore. In a mouse model of sepsis, disulfiram reduced inflammatory cytokines and mortality. Disulfiram also is a low micromolar inhibitor of the Mpro and PLpro viral proteases of SARS-CoV-2.

To investigate the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and severity of COVID-19, we carried out an epidemiological study in the CDW. The VA dataset used has 944,127 patients tested for SARS-Cov-2, 167,327 with a positive test, and 2,233 on disulfiram, of which 188 had a positive SARS-Cov-2 test. A multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorders, and Charlson comorbidity score revealed a reduced incidence of COVID-19 with disulfiram use with a hazard ratio of 0.66 and 95% confidence interval of 0.57 to 0.76 (P < 0.001). There were no deaths among the 188 SARS-Cov-2 positive patients treated with disulfiram. The expected number of deaths would have been 5-6 according to the 3% death rate among the untreated (P-value 0.03).

Our finding of a lower hazard ratio and less severe outcomes for COVID-19 in patients treated with disulfiram compared to those not treated is a statistical association and does not prove any causative effect of disulfiram. However, the results of this study suggest that there is a pharmacological contribution to the reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19 with the use of disulfiram. Given the known anti-inflammatory and viral anti-protease effects of disulfiram, it is reasonable and urgent to initiate accelerated clinical trials to assess whether disulfiram reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity and death.

STRUCTURED OUTLINEO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSIdentifying already approved medications with well characterized antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties supported by real world evidence as candidates for clinical trials for repurposing is an important strategy to manage the pandemic given the ongoing challenges with producing and administering vaccines, the emergence of more infectious viral mutants and the paucity of approved therapies.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe results of this study suggest that disulfiram use contributes to a reduced incidence of COVID-19.

200,23793,Mean Vitamin D levels in 19 European Countries & COVID-19 Mortality over 10 months,"ObjectivesReports early in the epidemic linking low mean national Vitamin D level with increased COVID-19 death, and until recently little research on the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on severity of COVID-19, led to this update of the initial report studying mortality up to the end of January 2021.

Methods, Design and SettingCoronavirus pandemic data for 19 European countries were downloaded from Our World in Data, which was last updated on January 24, 2021. Data from March 21, 2020 to January 22, 2021 were included in the statistical analysis. Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean data were collected by literature review. Poisson mixed-effect model was used to model the data.

ResultsEuropean countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID-19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean greater than 50, relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068 - 4.347, p-value = 0.032). A statistically significant negative moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean and the number of COVID-19 deaths for each 14-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic time period.

ConclusionsThe observation of the significantly lower COVID-19 mortality rates in countries with lowest annual sun exposure but highest mean Vitamin-D (25)-HD levels provides support for more awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy due to emergence of large number of COVID-19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these observations.

Strengths of this studyLarge number of different European populations studied with different policies of food fortification and different population Vitamin D levels

Ten months of longitudinal study during rise and fall and rise again of the epidemic

Limitations of this studyBased on population Vitamin D levels published before the beginning of the pandemic. Though there hasnt been a pan-European national/international health education initiative about Vitamin D and COVID-19 infection, it has been well covered in the media and could have resulted in changes, though probably minor, at the national level.

We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among undergraduate medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February - 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, hurried testing of vaccines prior to launch and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Risk perception regarding contracting COVID-19 vaccine reduced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitation in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers. Prior adult vaccination didnt have an effect upon COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted awareness campaigns, regulatory oversight of vaccine trials and public release of safety and efficacy data and trust building activities could further reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students.",12/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.12.21253444,Suman Saurabh,"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur",medrxiv,0,0,,
202,23943,Vaccine escape in a heterogeneous population: insights for SARS-CoV-2 from a simple model,"As a counter measure to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there has been swift development and clinical trial assessment of candidate vaccines, with subsequent deployment as part of mass vaccination campaigns. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated the ability to mutate and develop variants, which can modify epidemiological properties and potentially also the effectiveness of vaccines.

The widespread deployment of highly effective vaccines may rapidly exert selection pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus directed towards mutations that escape the vaccine induced immune response. This is particularly concerning whilst infection is widespread. By developing and analysing a mathematical model of two population groupings with differing vulnerability and contact rates, we explore the impact of the deployment of vaccine amongst the population on R, cases, disease abundance and vaccine escape pressure.

The results from this model illustrate two insights (i) vaccination aimed at reducing prevalence could be more effective at reducing disease than directly vaccinating the vulnerable; (ii) the highest risk for vaccine escape can occur at intermediate levels of vaccination. This work demonstrates a key principle that the careful targeting of vaccines towards particular population groups could reduce disease as much as possible whilst limiting the risk of vaccine escape.",28/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.14.21253544,Julia Rose Gog,University of Cambridge,medrxiv,0,0,,

In the U.S., preparations for challenge trials with the novel coronavirus are complete, and in the U.K., challenge trials have recently begun. However, ethical concerns have been raised about the potential for invalid consent or exploitation. These concerns largely reflect worries that challenge trial volunteers may be unusually risk-seeking or too economically vulnerable to refuse the payments these trials provide, rather than being motivated primarily by altruistic goals. We conducted the first large-scale survey of intended human challenge trial volunteers and found that SARS-CoV-2 challenge trial volunteers exhibit high levels of altruistic motivations without any special indication of poor risk perception or economic vulnerability. Findings indicate that challenge trials with the novel coronavirus can attract volunteers with background conditions, attitudes, and motivations that should allay key ethical concerns.",17/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.14.21253548,Abigail A.

204,24260,Comparison between one and two dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prioritisation for a fixed number of vaccine doses,"BackgroundThe swift development of vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2, which have been shown to generate significant immune responses and offer considerable protection against disease, has been met with worldwide commendation. However, in the context of an ongoing pandemic there is an interplay between infection and vaccination. While infection can grow exponentially, potentially overwhelming healthcare resources, vaccination rates are generally limited by both supply and logistics. With the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines receiving medical approval requiring two doses, there has been scrutiny on the spacing between doses; an elongated period between doses would allow more of the population to receive a first vaccine dose in the short-term generating wide-spread partial immunity.

MethodsFocusing on data from England, we investigated prioritisation of a one dose or two dose vaccination schedule given a fixed number of vaccine doses and with respect to a measure of maximising averted deaths. We optimised outcomes for two different estimates of population size and relative risk of mortality for at-risk groups within the Phase 1 vaccine priority order in England, for different amounts of available vaccine and for different vaccine efficacies.

FindingsWe find that vaccines offering relatively high protection from the first dose (compared to the efficacy derived from two doses) favour strategies that prioritise giving more people one dose rather than a smaller number two. The optimal mix of one and two doses between the defined priority groups of Phase 1 shows a pattern of returning to give second doses to the highest risk groups as the number of available doses increases.

DiscussionWhile this work highlights that an optimal timing of first and second doses between the Phase 1 priority groups can substantially reduce the overall mortality risk to the population, there also needs to be careful consideration of the precise timing between first and second doses as well as the logistics of vaccine delivery.",24/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.15.21253542,Matt J Keeling,University of Warwick,medrxiv,0,0,,

Interpretations of the decrease have focused on changing factors (e.g. mask-wearing, vaccines, etc.), but predictive models largely ignore heterogeneity in behaviorally-driven exposure risks among distinct groups. We present a simplified compartmental model with differential mixing in two behaviorally distinct groups. We show how homophily in behavior, risk, and exposure can lead to early peaks and rapid declines that critically do not signal the end of the outbreak. Instead, higher exposure risk groups may more rapidly exhaust available susceptibles while the lower risk group are still in a (slower) growth phase of their outbreak curve. This simplified model demonstrates that complex incidence curves, such as those currently seen in the US, can be generated without changes to fundamental drivers of disease dynamics.

We mimicked responses of individuals by sampling NAb subsets of known sizes from the landscape and found that they recapitulated responses of convalescent patients. Combining individual responses with a mathematical model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination, we predicted how the population-level protection conferred would increase with the NAb response to vaccination. Our predictions captured the outcomes of vaccination trials. Our formalism may help optimize vaccination protocols, given limited vaccine availability.

208,24107,"""This is about the coolest thing I've ever seen is that you just showed right up."" COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults: Qualitative data from two samples","BackgroundHomeless-experienced populations are at increased risk of exposure to SARS CoV-2 due to their living environments and face increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease due to underlying health conditions. Little is known about COVID-19 testing and vaccination acceptability among homeless-experienced populations.

ObjectiveTo understand the facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults.

DesignWe conducted in-depth interviews with participants from July-October 2020. We purposively recruited participants from 1) a longitudinal cohort of homeless-experienced older adults in Oakland, CA (n=37) and 2) a convenience sample of people (n=57) during a mobile outreach COVID-19 testing event in San Francisco.

ParticipantsAdults with current or past experience of homelessness.

ApproachWe asked participants about their experiences with and attitudes towards COVID-19 testing and their perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations. We used participant observation techniques to document the interactions between testing teams and those approached for testing. We audio-recorded, transcribed and content analyzed all interviews and identified major themes and subthemes.

Key ResultsParticipants found incentivized COVID-19 testing administered in unsheltered settings and supported by community health outreach workers (CHOWs) to be acceptable. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccine acceptability, citing a desire to return to routine life and civic responsibility. Those who expressed hesitancy cited a desire to see trial data, concerns that vaccines included infectious materials, and mistrust of the government.

ConclusionsParticipants expressed positive evaluations of the incentivized, mobile COVID-19 testing supported by CHOWs in unsheltered settings. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy concerns must be addressed when designing vaccine delivery strategies that overcome access challenges. Based on the successful implementation of COVID-19 testing, we recommend mobile delivery of vaccines using trusted CHOWs to address concerns and facilitate wider access to and uptake of the COVID vaccine.",20/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.16.21253743,Margot B Kushel,UCSF Center for Vulnerable Populations at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center; UCSF Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative,medrxiv,0,0,,
209,24291,How safe is Covishield (ChAdOx1nCoV-19) vaccine? Experience from a tertiary care hospital in South India,"BackgroundCOVID vaccine has been recently rolled out for Health care workers in India. Though vaccine trials and data are available, people, including HCWs, need more real-life data from their contexts to get over the vaccine hesitancy. We aimed to determine the incidence of Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) among HCWs after their first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 218 staff of a tertiary care hospital. We circulated a google form with informed consent on the hospital WhatsApp platform and asked them to self-report their vaccination experience.

ResultsTwo thirds (69.7% (152/218), 95% CI: 63.1-75.7) had minor AEFI, and none had severe AEFI. Body ache (46.8% (102/218), 95% CI :40 - 53.6) was the most common symptom followed by headache (30.3% (66/218), 95% CI :24.2 - 36.8) and fever (22% 948/218), 95% CI :16.7 - 28.1). Most of them (39.4% (87/218) 95% CI:32.9 - 46.2) experienced symptoms within 4-24 hours after taking the vaccine while 22.3% (49/218) (95% CI: 17.1 - 28.6) experienced it after a day. Majority of the HCWs (78.9% (172/218), 95% CI: 72.8 - 84.1) were anxious before the vaccination. Younger age group and female gender were significantly associated with AEFI compared to their counterparts.

ConclusionHCWs experienced minor, self-limiting AEFI with the first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19. The hospital reported no serious AEFI following the vaccination",24/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.16.21253744,Carolin George Elizabeth,Bangalore Baptist Hospital,medrxiv,0,0,,
213,24159,"Addressing disruptions in childhood routine immunisation services during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives and lessons learned from Liberia, Nepal, and Senegal","The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted multifaceted disruptions to routine immunisation from global to local levels, affecting every aspect of vaccine supply, access, and demand. Since March 2020, country programmes have implemented a range of strategies to either continue vaccination services during COVID-19 measures like  lockdown and/or resume services when risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be appropriately mitigated. Through the Exemplars in Global Health partnership in Liberia, Nepal, and Senegal, we conducted interviews with immunisation programme managers and ministry of health leadership to better understand how they have addressed the myriad vaccination challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. From establishing alternative modes of service delivery to combatting vaccine distrust and rumours via risk communication campaigns, many routine immunisation programmes have demonstrated how to adapt, resume, and/or maintain vital vaccination efforts during the COVID-19 crisis. Yet millions of children remain un- or under-vaccinated worldwide, and the same programmes striving to implement catch-up services for missed doses and postponed mass campaigns will also soon be tasked with COVID-19 vaccine deployment. As laid bare by the current pandemic, the worlds gains against vaccine-preventable diseases are fragile: enshrined by a delicate global ecosystem of logistics, supply, and procurement, the success of routine immunisation ultimately rests upon dedicated programme staff, the resources and support available to them, and then the trust in and demand for vaccines by their recipients. Our collective lessons learned during COVID-19 offer insights in programme adaptation and resilience that, if prioritised, could strengthen equitable, sustainable vaccine delivery for all populations.

Summary boxO_LIKey message 1: As the COVID-19 pandemic affected routine immunisation services worldwide, country programmes have used a range of mitigation strategies to maintain vaccine delivery and/or resume interrupted programming. Interviews with immunisation programme managers and Ministry of Health staff provided key perspectives and lessons learned on how countries have approached routine immunisation services during the COVID-19 crisis.
C_LIO_LIKey message 2: Key themes for mitigating COVID-19s effects on routine immunisation included prioritising continued services with strengthened infection prevention control; identifying alternative locations and approaches to providing vaccine services (e.g., conducting door-to-door vaccination if facility-based services were not possible); engaging in effective communications and mobilisation activities, especially to offset misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines; setting up systems and strategies for reaching children who missed doses amid periods of disruption; and conducting catch-up campaigns as soon as SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks could be minimised.
C_LIO_LIKey message 3: The ways in which COVID-19 has affected routine immunisation services have varied over time and across settings, underscoring the importance of contextually-tailored mitigation efforts and adaptation given evolving challenges amid an ongoing pandemic. As countries prepare and initiate roll-out COVID-19 vaccines, it will be vital to avoid one-size-fits-all implementation strategies and support the continuance of routine immunisation services through this next phase of COVID-19 response.

Evaluation of current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays have been performed on samples from severe COVID-19 hospitalised patients. However, robust assay development requires assessment in asymptomatic and non-hospitalised individuals to determine if serological assays are sensitive to detect waning and mild antibody responses. Our study evaluated the performance characteristics between two high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assays (Abbott and Roche) and The binding site (TBS) Anti-Spike IgG/A/M ELISA kit in healthcare workers.

Methods236 samples were collected from Portsmouth Hospital University NHS Trust (PHU) and The Dudley Group NHS Trust and analysed for SARS-CoV-2 serology. We derived concordance, agreement and assay performance as well as using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to redefine the assay threshold of the Abbott assay.

ResultsResult concordance between the Abbott and TBS was 66%. Discrepant samples were analysed using the Roche assay which showed 100% agreement with the TBS assay. In samples analysed >58 days post-PCR, the sensitivity of Abbott and Roche was 100%. In samples analysed >100 days post-PCR the sensitivity of the Abbott assay dropped to 77.2% but remained at 100% for the Roche assay. A redefined Abbott threshold of 0.64 increased the sensitivity to 90% giving results similar to Roche and TBS assays

AbstractSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology testing is key for assessing seroprevalence and antibody response post-vaccination in immunocompromised patients. Here we performed a comparison between two high-throughput nucleocapsid assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2) and The Binding Site (TBS) anti-Spike IgG/A/M-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kit. 236 samples were collected across 2 sites, Portsmouth Hospital University NHS Trust (PHU) and The Dudley Group NHS Trust. We derived concordance, agreement and assay performance as well as using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to redefine the assay threshold of the Abbott assay. Result concordance between the Abbott and TBS was 66%. Discrepant samples were analysed using the Roche assay which showed 100% agreement with the TBS assay. In samples analysed >58 days post-PCR, the sensitivity of Abbott and Roche was 100%. In samples analysed >100 days post-PCR the sensitivity of the Abbott assay dropped to 77.2% but remained at 100% for the Roche assay. A redefined Abbott threshold of 0.64 increased the sensitivity to 90% giving results similar to the Roche and TBS assays. In conclusion, this study demonstrated Abbott assay had a lower sensitivity in comparison to TBS and Roche. This study established TBS can be implemented as a viable alternative for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing where high-throughput assays are not available on site. Furthermore, anti-spike assays, such as TBS, could be used to monitor vaccination responses to deduce SARS-CoV-2 population-immunity. Further optimisation studies are required to evaluate the performance characteristics of these assays which could facilitate widescale sero-epidemiological surveillance.",24/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.19.21253518,Dinesh Mohanraj,Portsmouth Hospital University NHS Trust,medrxiv,0,0,,
216,24069,Effect of information about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and side effects on behavioural intentions: two online experiments,"The success of mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns rests on widespread uptake. However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication--including uncertainty--about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2,097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2,217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g. social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.",20/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.19.21253963,John R.

218,24304,Willingness to Vaccinate against COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers: An Online Survey in 10 Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region,"BackgroundWillingness of healthcare workers to be vaccinated is an important factor to be consider for successful COVID-19 vaccination programme. Our study aimed to understand the willingness of health workers to receive COVID-19 vaccine and associated concerns across 10 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO).

MethodA cross-sectional study was conducted in January 2021 among healthcare workers using an online survey. A total of 2806 health workers (Physicians, Nurses and Pharmacists) completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. S

ResultsMore than half of the respondents (58.0%) were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccine, even if the vaccination is not mandatory for them. On the other hand, 25.7% of respondents were not willing to undertake COVID-19 vaccination while 16.3 % answered undecided. The top three reasons for not intending to be vaccinated were unreliability of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials (62.0%), fear of the side effects of the vaccine (45.3%), and that COVID-19 vaccine will not give immunity for a long period of time (23.1%).

ConclusionOverall, our study revealed suboptimal acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine among our respondents in the EMRO region. Significant refusal of COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare professionals can reverse hard-won progress in building public trust in COVID-19 vaccination program. Our findings suggest the need to develop tailored strategies to address concerns identified in the study in order to ensure optimal vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in the EMRO.",13/06/2021,10.1101/2021.03.20.21253892,Mohammad Yasir Essar,"Medical Research Center, Kateb University, Kabul, Afghanistan",medrxiv,0,0,,
219,24318,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 tracks early interstate transmission of P.1 lineage and diversification within P.2 clade in Brazil,"The sharp increase of COVID-19 cases in late 2020 has made Brazil the new epicenter of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages P.1 and P.2, first identified respectively in Manaus and Rio de Janeiro, have been associated with potentially higher transmission rates and antibody neutralization escape. In this study, we performed a whole-genome sequencing of 185 samples isolated from three out of the five Brazilian regions, including Amazonas (North region), Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba and Bahia (Northeast region), and Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) aiming to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations that could be involved in the surge of COVID19 cases in Brazil. Here, we showed a widespread dispersion of P.1 and P.2 across Brazilian regions. Except for Manaus, P.2 was the predominant lineage identified country-wise. P.2 lineage was estimated to have originated in February, 2020 and has diverged into new clades. Interstate transmission of P.2 was detected since March, but reached its peak in December, 2020 and January, 2021. Transmission of P.1 was also high in December. P.1 origin was inferred to have happened in August 2020. We also confirmed the presence of the variant under investigation (VUI) NP13L, recently described in the southernmost region of Brazil, to have spread across the Northeastern states. P.1, P.2 and NP13L are descended from the ancient B.1.1.28 strain, although during the first phase of the pandemic in Brazil presence of B.1.1.33 strain was also reported. We investigate here the possible occurrence of a new variant of interest descending from B.1.1.33 that also carries the E484K mutation. Indeed, the recurrent report of many novel SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Brazil could be due to the absence of effective control measures resulting in high SARS-CoV2 transmission rates. Altogether, our findings provided a landscape of the critical state of SARS-CoV-2 across Brazil and confirm the need to sustain continuous sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide in order to early identify novel variants of interest and to monitor for vaccine effectiveness.",26/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.21.21253418,Ana Tereza R De Vasconcelos,"Laboratorio de Bioinformatica, Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica, Petropolis, Brazil",medrxiv,0,0,,

In a parallel effort to that for vaccines, the identification of therapeutics that have near-term potential to be available and easily administered is critical. Using the United States, European Union, and World Health Organization clinical trial registries, we reviewed COVID-19 therapeutic agents currently under investigation. The search was limited to oral or potentially oral agents, with at least a putative anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus mechanism, and with at least 3 registered trials. We describe the available evidence regarding agents that met these criteria and additionally discuss the need for additional investment by the global scientific community in large well-coordinated trials of accessible agents and their combinations in LMICs. The search yielded 636, 175, and 930 trials, in the US, EU, and WHO trial registers, respectively. These trials covered 17 oral or potentially oral repurposed agents that are currently used as antimicrobials and immunomodulatory therapeutics and therefore have established safety. The available evidence regarding proposed mechanism of actions, clinical efficacy, and potential limitations is summarized. We also identified the need for large well-coordinated trials of accessible agents and their combinations in LMICs. Several repurposed agents have potential to be safe, available, and easily administrable to treat COVID-19.

221,24497,"Hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients in Belgium treated with statins, ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted life throughout the world. Newly developed vaccines promise relief to people who live in high-income countries, although vaccines and expensive new treatments are unlikely to arrive in time to help people who live in low-and middle-income countries. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Several widely available drugs like statins, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have immunometabolic activities that (among other things) maintain or restore endothelial cell function. For this reason, we undertook an observational study in four Belgian hospitals to determine whether in-hospital treatment with these drugs could improve survival in 959 COVID-19 patients. We found that treatment with statins and ACEIs/ARBs reduced 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, combination treatment with these drugs resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the odds of hospital mortality (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.17-0.69). These findings were in general agreement with other published studies. Additional observational studies and clinical trials are needed to convincingly show that in-hospital treatment with statins, ACEIs/ARBs, and especially their combination saves lives.",26/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.24.21252687,David Fedson,retired,medrxiv,0,0,,

224,24521,Hemodialysis Patients Show a Highly Diminished Antibody Response after COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination Compared to Healthy Controls,"1.1.1 Background and ObjectivesHemodialysis patients are prone to infection with SARS-COV2 and show a high probability of a severe course of disease and high mortality when infected. In many countries hemodialysis patients are prioritised in vaccination programs to protect this vulnerable community. However, no hemodialysis patients were included in efficacy trials of SARS CoV-2 vaccines and therefore efficacy and safety data for this patient group are lacking. These data would be critical, since hemodialysis patients showed decreased responses against various other vaccines and this could mean decreased response to SARS CoV-2 vaccines.

1.2 Design, setting, participants, and measurementsWe conducted a prospective cohort study consisting of a group of 81 hemodialysis patients and 80 healthy controls who were vaccinated with mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (BionTech/Pfizer, 2 doses with an interval of 21 days). Anti-SARS-COV-2 S antibody response in all participants was measured 21 days after the second dose. The groups were compared with univariate quantile regressions and a multiple analysis. Adverse events (AEs) of the vaccination were assessed with a standardized questionnaire. We also performed a correlation of HBs-Antibody response with the SARS-COV-2 antibody response in the hemodialysis patients.

1.3 ResultsDialysis patients had significantly lower Anti-SARS-COV-2 S antibody titres than healthy control patients 21 days after vaccination with BNT162b2 (median dialysis Patients 171 U/ml versus median controls 2500 U/ml). Age also had a significant but less pronounced influence on antibody titres. Dialysis patients showed less AEs than the control group. No significant correlation was found for Hepatitis B vaccine antibody response and SARS CoV-2 vaccine antibody response.

1.4 ConclusionsHemodialysis patients exhibit highly diminished SARS-COV-2 S antibody titres compared to a cohort of controls. Therefore these patients could be much less protected by SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccination than expected. Alternative vaccination schemes must be considered and preventive measures must be maintained after vaccination.",26/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254259,Benedikt Simon,LKH Mistelbach,medrxiv,0,0,,
225,24652,A RANDOMIZED TRIAL - INTENSIVE TREATMENT BASED IN IVERMECTIN AND IOTA-CARRAGEENAN AS PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS FOR COVID- 19 IN HEALTHCARE AGENTS,"Key PointO_ST_ABSIMPORTANCEC_ST_ABSThe emergency of COVID-19 requires the implementation of urgent strategies to prevent the spread of the disease, mainly in health personnel, who are the most exposed and has the highest risk of becoming infected with the SARS-COV-2. Drug repurposing is a pragmatic strategy, a faster and cheaper option, compared to the new drug development that has proven successful for many drugs and can be a key tool in emergency situations such as the current one that requires quick action. In addition, considering the limited access to vaccines for developing countries, preventive use of ivermectin can be a palliative that minimizes the risks of infection.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the protective effect of the combination Ivermectin / Iota-Carrageenan (IVER/IOTACRC), intensive treatment with repeated administration in oral- and nasal-spray, respectively, as a prophylaxis treatment prior to exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in health personnel at Public Healthcare Centers.

PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND SETTINGRandomized controlled 1-1 clinical trial in Personal Health, n = 234. The subjects were divided into experimental (EG: n=117; 39.6 {+/-} 9.4 years old, 65F) and control groups (CG: n=117; 38.4 {+/-} 7.4 years old, 61F). The EG received Ivermectin orally 2 tablets of 6 mg = 12 mg every 7 days, and Iota-Carrageenan 6 sprays per day for 4 weeks. All participants were evaluated by physical examination COVID-19 diagnosed with negative RT-PCR at the beginning, final, and follow-up of the protocol. Differences between the variables were determined using the Chi-square test. The proportion test almost contagious subject and the contagion risk (Odds Ratio) were calculated using software STATA. The level of statistical significance was reached when p-Value < 0.05.

RESULTThe number of subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in EG was lower, only 4 of 117 (3.4%) than subjects in CG: 25 of 117 (21.4%) (P-Value = 1.10-5). Nineteen patients had mild symptoms, 4 were in EG whereas, 15 were in CG (p-Value = 0.001). Seven subjects were moderate, and 3 with severe diagnostics, all them in CG. The probability (Odds Ratio) of becoming ill with COVID-19 was significantly lower in EG with values of 0.13, 95% 0.03 to 0.40; p-Value = 1.10-4, this value (<1) indicates a protective effect of the IVER/IOTACRC in the EG. Logistic regression test demonstrated that treatment was effective to prevent COVID-19 (Odds Ratio 0.11, 95% 0.03 to 0.33; p-Value = 1.10-4). We also found that when increase the age, decrease contagious risk (Odds Ratio 0, 93, 95% 0.88 to 0.98, p-Value= 0, 02). On the other hand, the probability of contracting COVID-19 was dependent on the patients preexisting comorbidity (Odds Ratio 5.58, 95% 2.20 to 14.16, p-Value = 1.10-5). The other variables sex and designation were independent.

CONCLUSIONThe intensive preventive treatment (short-term) with IVER/IOTACRC was able to reduce the number of health workers infected with COVID-19. This treatment had also effect in preventing the severity of the disease, since all patients treated were mild. We propose a new therapeutic alternative for prevention and short-term intervention scheme (intensive) that is of benefit of the health worker in this pandemic accelerated time. This intervention did not produce lack of adherence to treatment or adverse effects.

226,24594,A randomized controlled trial of a video intervention shows evidence of increasing COVID-19 vaccination intention,"Increasing acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is imperative for public health, as unvaccinated individuals may impede the ability to reach herd immunity. Previous research on educational interventions to overcome vaccine hesitancy have shown mixed effects in increasing vaccination intention, although much of this work has focused on parental attitudes toward childhood vaccination. In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether vaccination intention changes after viewing an animated YouTube video explaining how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work. We exposed participants to one of four interventions - watching the video with a male narrator, watching the same video with a female narrator, reading the text of the transcript of the video, or receiving no information (control group). We found that participants who watched the version of the video with a male narrator expressed statistically significant increased vaccination intention compared to the control group. The video with a female narrator had more variation in results. As a whole, there was a non-significant increased vaccination intention when analyzing all participants who saw the video with a female narrator; however, for politically conservative participants there was decreased vaccination intention for this intervention, particularly at a threshold between being currently undecided and expressing probable interest. These results are encouraging for the ability of interventions as simple as YouTube videos to increase vaccination propensity, although the inconsistent response to the video with a female narrator demonstrates the potential for bias to affect how certain groups respond to different messengers.

Significance StatementWidespread vaccination is important for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates whether communicating the science behind new COVID-19 vaccines can increase peoples willingness to get vaccinated. We examined the effectiveness of an eight-minute animated video explaining how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work, varying between a male narrator, a female narrator, and a control group. Participants who saw the video with a male narrator expressed a greater intent to get vaccinated than the control group. Participants who saw the video with a female narrator had more varied responses, including a decreased intent to get vaccinated among political conservatives. These findings indicate that science education may help increase vaccine uptake, but that beliefs about gender may influence how people receive such information.",29/03/2021,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254433,Leah S Witus,Macalester College,medrxiv,0,0,,

Results21,943 individuals completed the survey (100% with comorbidities including 27% cancer, 23% autoimmune diseases, 38% chronic lung diseases). 10% declared they would not, 4% stated they probably would not, and 5% were not sure they would agree to vaccination (hesitancy rate 19%). Factors associated with hesitancy included younger age, female gender, black-Pacific-Island-Native American heritage, less formal education, conservative political tendencies, resistance to masks or routine influenza vaccinations, and distrust of media coverage. 5501 (25%) had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine injection, including 29% of US participants. Following the first injection, 69% self-reported local and 40% systemic reactions, which increased following the second injection to 76% and 67%, respectively, with patterns mimicking clinical trials.

ConclusionNearly one in five individuals with serious comorbid conditions harbor COVID-19 hesitancy. Early safety experiences among those who have been vaccinated should be reassuring.

HighlightsO_LIIndividuals with serious comorbid conditions, including cancer, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and therefore have been prioritized for vaccination

238,24983,Modelling vaccination capacity at mass vaccination hubs and general practice clinics,"COVID-19 population vaccination programs are underway globally. In Australia, the federal government has entered into three agreements for the supply of vaccines, with roll-out beginning for the highest priority groups in February 2021. Expansion of the vaccination program throughout February and March failed to meet government targets and this has been attributed to international supply issues. However, Australia has local capacity to manufacture one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine weekly and once fully operational this will greatly increase the national vaccination capacity. Under current plans, these vaccine doses will be distributed primarily through a network of general practices, to be joined in later phases by community pharmacies. It remains unclear whether these small distribution venues have the logistical capacity to administer vaccines at the rate they will become available. To inform this discussion, we applied stochastic queue network models to estimate the capacity of vaccination sites based on assumptions about appointment schedules, service times and available staff numbers. We specified distinct queueing models for two delivery modes: (i) mass vaccination hubs located in hospitals or sports arenas and (ii) smaller clinics situated in general practices or community pharmacies. Based on our assumed service times, the potential daily throughput for an eight hour clinic at a mass vaccination hub ranged from around 500 vaccinations for a relatively small hub to 1,400 vaccinations a day for a relatively large hub. For GP vaccination clinics, the estimated daily throughput ranged from about 100 vaccinations a day for a relatively small practice to almost 300 a day for a relatively large practice. Stress tests showed that for both delivery modes, sites with higher staff numbers were more robust to system pressures, such as increased arrivals or staff absences, and mass vaccination sites were more robust that GP clinics. Our analysis is accompanied by an interactive web-based queue simulation applet, which allows users to explore queue performance under their own assumptions regarding appointments, service times and staff availability. Different vaccine delivery modes offer distinct benefits and may be particularly appealing to specific population segments. A combination of expanded mass vaccination hubs and expanded GP vaccination is likely to achieve mass vaccination faster than either mode alone.",07/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.07.21255067,Mark J Hanly,"Centre for Big Data Research in Health, UNSW Sydney",medrxiv,0,0,,

241,25118,Incidence of Long-term Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Related to Pain and Other Symptoms: A Living Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"ImportancePersistent symptoms are reported in patients who survive the initial stage of COVID-19, often referred to as ""long COVID"" or ""post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" (PASC); however, evidence on incidence is still lacking, and symptoms relevant to pain are yet to be assessed.

ObjectiveTo determine long-term symptoms in COVID-19 survivors after infection.

Data SourcesA literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and CHINAL and preprint servers MedR{chi}iv and BioR{chi}iv through January 15, 2021.

Study SelectionEligible studies were those reporting patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and who showed any symptoms persisting beyond the acute phase.

Data Extraction and SynthesisIncidence rate of symptoms were pooled using inverse variance methods with a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was pain-related symptoms such as headache or myalgia. Secondary outcomes were symptoms relevant to pain (depression or muscle weakness) and symptoms frequently reported (anosmia and dyspnea). Heterogeneity among studies and publication bias for each symptom were estimated. The source of heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression, with follow-up period, age and sex as covariates.

ResultsIn total, 35 studies including 18,711 patients were eligible. Eight pain-related symptoms and 26 other symptoms were identified. The highest pooled incidence among pain-related symptoms was chest pain (17%, 95% CI, 12%-25%), followed by headache (16%, 95% CI, 9%-27%), arthralgia (13%, 95% CI, 7%-24%), neuralgia (12%, 95% CI, 3%-38%) and abdominal pain (11%, 95% CI, 7%-16%). The highest pooled incidence among other symptoms was fatigue (45%, 95% CI, 32%-59%), followed by insomnia (26%, 95% CI, 9%-57%), dyspnea (25%, 95% CI, 15%-38%), weakness (25%, 95% CI, 8%-56%) and anosmia (19%, 95% CI, 13%-27%). Substantial heterogeneity was identified (I2, 50-100%). Meta-regression analyses partially accounted for the source of heterogeneity, and yet, 53% of the symptoms remained unexplained.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe current meta-analysis may provide a complete picture of incidence in PASC. It remains unclear, however, whether post-COVID symptoms progress or regress over time or to what extent PASC are associated with age or sex.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the incidence rate of long-term post-acute sequelae of SARS-Cov-2 infection related to pain and other symptoms?

FindingsIn the current meta-analysis of 35 studies with 18,711 patients, the highest estimated incidence among pain-related symptoms was chest pain (17%), followed by headache (16%), arthralgia (13%), neuralgia (12%) and abdominal pain (11%). That among other symptoms was fatigue (45%), followed by insomnia (26%), dyspnea (25%), weakness (25%) and anosmia (19%).

MeaningThese findings suggest that long-term post-acute sequelae of SARS-Cov-2 infection must not be overlooked or underestimated especially when vaccination has become the focus.",11/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.08.21255109,Toshiya Shiga,International University of Health and Welfare,medrxiv,0,0,,
242,25230,Two Distinct Dynamic Process Models of COVID-19 Spread with Divergent Vaccination Outcomes,"Kinematic models of contagion-based viral transmission describe patterns of events over time (e.g., new infections), relying typically on systems of differential equations to reproduce those patterns. By contrast, agent-based models of viral transmission seek to relate those events or patterns of events to causes, expressed in terms of factors (parameters) that determine the dynamics that give rise to those events.

This paper is concerned with the dynamics of contagion-based spread of infection. Dynamics that reflect time homogeneous vs inhomogeneous transmission rates are generated via an agent-based infectious disease modeling tool (CovidSIMVL - github.com/ecsendmail/MultiverseContagion). These different dynamics are treated as causal factors and are related to differences in vaccine efficacy in an array of simulated vaccination trials. Visualizations of simulated trials and associated metrics illustrate graphically some cogent reasons for not effectively hard-coding assumptions of dynamic temporal homogeneity, which come  pre-packaged with the mass action incidence assumption that underpins typical equation-based models of infection spread.",14/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.09.21255166,Ernie Chang,Consultant,medrxiv,0,0,,

ObjectiveTo characterize anti-COVID-19 antibodies in follicular fluid and compare ovarian follicle function in women following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, and non-infected, unvaccinated controls.

DesignThis is a cohort study conducted between February 1 and March 10, 2021.

SettingA single university hospital-based IVF clinic.

ParticipantsConsecutive sample of female patients undergoing oocyte retrieval.

InterventionsConsenting patients were recruited and assigned to one of three study groups: recovering from confirmed COVID 19 (n=9); vaccinated (n=9); and uninfected, non-vaccinated controls (n=14). Serum and follicular fluid samples were taken and analyzed for anti-COVID IgG as well as estrogen, progesterone and HSPG2 concentration, as well as the number and maturity of aspirated oocytes and previous estrogen and progesterone measurements.

Main outcome measuresFollicular function, including steroidogenesis, follicular response to the LH/hCG trigger, and oocyte quality biomarkers.

ResultsBoth natural and vaccine elicited anti-COVID IgG antibodies were detected in the follicular fluid in levels proportional to the IgG serum concentration. No differences were detected in any of the surrogate ovarian follicle quality reporting parameters.

Conclusions and relevanceBoth SARS-COV-2 infection and vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine mediate IgG immunity that crosses into the follicular fluid. No detrimental effect on follicular function was detected.

244,25162,COVID-19 vaccine perceptions: An observational study on Reddit,"ObjectivesAs COVID-19 vaccinations accelerate in many countries, narratives skeptical of vaccination have also spread through social media. Open online forums like Reddit provide an opportunity to quantitatively examine COVID-19 vaccine perceptions over time. We examine COVID-19 misinformation on Reddit following vaccine scientific announcements.

MethodsWe collected all posts on Reddit from January 1 2020 - December 14 2020 (n=266,840) that contained both COVID-19 and vaccine-related keywords. We used topic modeling to understand changes in word prevalence within topics after the release of vaccine trial data. Social network analysis was also conducted to determine the relationship between Reddit communities (subreddits) that shared COVID-19 vaccine posts, and the movement of posts between subreddits.

ResultsThere was an association between a Pfizer press release reporting 90% efficacy and increased discussion on vaccine misinformation. We observed an association between Johnson and Johnson temporarily halting its vaccine trials and reduced misinformation. We found that information skeptical of vaccination was first posted in a subreddit (r/Coronavirus) which favored accurate information and then reposted in subreddits associated with antivaccine beliefs and conspiracy theories (e.g. conspiracy, LockdownSkepticism).

ConclusionsOur findings can inform the development of interventions where individuals determine the accuracy of vaccine information, and communications campaigns to improve COVID-19 vaccine perceptions. Such efforts can increase individual- and population-level awareness of accurate and scientifically sound information regarding vaccines and thereby improve attitudes about vaccines. Further research is needed to understand how social media can contribute to COVID-19 vaccination services.

246,25224,Behavioral nudges increase COVID-19 vaccinations: Two randomized controlled trials,"Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic requires quick and effective strategies to maximize vaccine uptake. We present two sequential randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tackle this challenge with behavioral science insights. We deliver text-based nudges to UCLA Health patients one day (first RCT; N=113,229) and eight days (second RCT; N=90,662) after they receive notifications of vaccine eligibility. In the first RCT, text messages designed to make vaccination salient and easy to schedule boost appointment and vaccination rates by 86% and 26%, respectively. Nudges that make patients feel endowed with the vaccine heighten these effects, but addressing vaccine hesitancy via a video-based information intervention does not yield benefits beyond simple text. These results hold across ethnicity and age groups. By contrast, online experiments (N=2,003) soliciting hypothetical responses to the same messages reveal the opposite patterns, underscoring the importance of pilot-testing behavioral nudges in the real world before scaling them up. In the second RCT, we further find that receiving a second reminder boosts appointment and vaccination rates by 52% and 16%, respectively. Our findings suggest that text-based nudges can substantially increase and accelerate COVID-19 vaccinations at almost zero marginal cost, highlighting the promising role of behavioral science in addressing a critical component of the COVID-19 pandemic response.",14/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.12.21254876,Daniel M Croymans,"Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, 90095.

A pragmatic multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CARR-COV-02)","BackgroundIota-Carrageenan (I-C) is a sulfate polysaccharide synthesized by red algae, with demonstrated antiviral activity and clinical efficacy as nasal spray in the treatment of common cold. In vitro, I-C inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture.

MethodsThis is a pragmatic multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the use of a nasal spray containing I-C in the prophylaxis of COVID-19 in hospital personnel dedicated to care of COVID-19 patients.

Clinically healthy physicians, nurses, kinesiologists and others medical providers were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive four daily doses of I-C spray or placebo for 21 days.

The primary end point was clinical COVID-19, as confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction testing, over a period of 21 days. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04521322).

FindingsA total of 394 individuals were randomly assigned to receive I-C or placebo. Both treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics.

The incidence of COVID19 was significantly lower in the I-C group compared to placebo (1{middle dot}0% vs 5{middle dot}0%) (Odds Ratio 0{middle dot}19 (95% confidence interval 0{middle dot}05 to 0{middle dot}77; p= 0{middle dot}03). Workday loss in placebo group compared to I-Cc were 1.6% days / person (95% ci, 1.0 to 2.2); p <0.0001

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events across the two groups (17{middle dot}3% in the I-C group and 15{middle dot}2% in the placebo group, p= 0{middle dot}5).

InterpretationI-C showed significant efficacy in preventing SARS-Cov-2 infection in hospital personnel dedicated to care patients with COVID-19 disease.

An individual- based transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, OpenCOVID, was developed to compare the impact of various vaccination and NPI strategies on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. We estimate that any relaxation of NPIs in March 2021 will lead to increasing cases, hospitalisations, and deaths resulting in a  third wave in spring and into summer 2021. However, we find a cautious phased relaxation can substantially reduce population-level morbidity and mortality. We find that faster vaccination campaign can offset the size of such a wave, allowing more flexibility for NPI to be relaxed sooner. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that model results are particularly sensitive to the infectiousness of variant B.1.1.7.",20/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.14.21255503,Melissa A Penny,Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute,medrxiv,0,0,,
249,25321,Evaluating Vaccine Efficacy Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Although interim results from several large placebo-controlled phase 3 trials demonstrated high vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19, it is unknown how effective the vaccines are in preventing people from becoming asymptomatically infected and potentially spreading the virus unwittingly. It is more difficult to evaluate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection than against symptomatic COVID-19 because infection is not observed directly but rather is known to occur between two antibody or RT-PCR tests. Additional challenges arise as community transmission changes over time and as participants are vaccinated on different dates because of staggered enrollment or crossover before the end of the study. Here, we provide valid and efficient statistical methods for estimating potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection with blood or nasal samples under time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment, and blinded or unblinded crossover. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods through numerical studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial and the Prevent COVID U study. In addition, we assess how crossover and the frequency of diagnostic tests affect the precision of VE estimates.

250,25552,"Health Belief, Planned Behavior, or Psychological Antecedents: What predicts COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy better among the Bangladeshi Adults?","BackgroundThis study aimed to determine the prevalence and investigate the constellations of psychological determinants of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the Bangladeshi adult population utilizing the health belief model-HBM (perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19, perceived benefits of and barriers to COVID-19 vaccination, and cues to action), the theory of planned behavior-TPB (attitude toward COVId-19 vaccine, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and anticipated regret), and the novel 5C psychological antecedents (confidence, constraints, complacency, calculation, and collective responsibility). We compared the predictability of these theoretical frameworks to see which framework explains the highest variance in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

MethodsThis study adopted a cross-sectional research design. We collected data from a nationally representative sample of 1497 respondents through both online and face-to-face interviews. We employed multiple linear regression analysis to assess the predictability of each model of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

ResultsWe found a 41.1% prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among our study respondents. After controlling the effects of socio-economic, demographic, and other COVID-19 related covariates, we found that the TPB has the highest predictive power (adjusted R2 =0.43), followed by the 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination (adjusted R2 =0.32) and the HBM (adjusted R2 =0.31) in terms of explaining total variance in the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the adults of Bangladesh.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that theoretical frameworks like the HBM, the TPB, and the 5C psychological antecedents can be used to explore the psychological determinants of vaccine hesitancy, where the TBP has the highest predictability. Our findings can be used to design targeted interventions to reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake.

Key QuestionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABS There is a global-level insurgence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, where the majority of studies come from western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) countries.
 To date, an online survey found that the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Bangladesh was 32.5%.
 Few studies from WEIRD countries have adopted the Health Believe Model and/or the Theory of Planned Behavior to explore the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.


What are the new findings? This study found a 41.1% prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among a nationally representative sample of Bangladesh.
 After controlling the effects of demographic, socio-economic, and other COVID-19 related covariates, we found that the TPB has the highest predictive power, followed by the 5C psychological antecedents and the HBM in terms of explaining total variance in the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the adults of Bangladesh.


What do the new findings imply? Theoretical frameworks like the HBM, the TPB, and the 5C psychological antecedents can be used to explore the multitude of the psychological determinants of vaccine hesitancy, where the TPB has the highest predictability.

ObjectiveThe objective of this analysis was to determine if a statistically significant signal exists in post-marketing safety reports between CVA and the three COVID-19 vaccines being administered in the United States of America (Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen).

MethodsA pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis on adverse events reported with COVID-19 vaccines was conducted using data from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

ResultsA statistically significant signal was found between CVA events and each of the three COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTechs, Modernas and Janssens) in the VAERS database. Females and individuals of age 65 or older had higher number of case reports of CVA events with the COVID-19 vaccines. Females had also more COVID-19 adverse event reports in which a CVA was reported and resulted in the patient having permanent disability or death.

LimitationsRandomized controlled trials are needed to further analyze this signal.

ConclusionPatients should be made aware of the risk-benefit and symptoms to watch out for that may indicate the onset of a CVA and informed to seek medical care as soon as possible if they develop these symptoms.",27/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.19.21255768,Pushkar Aggarwal,University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,medrxiv,0,0,,

Continued pharmacovigilance is integral to mitigating the risk of rare adverse events that clinical trials are underpowered to detect, however, these anecdotal reports have led to the pause or withdrawal of some vaccines in many jurisdictions and exacerbated vaccine hesitancy at a critical moment in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the frequencies of CVST seen among individuals who received FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 94,818 doses), Moderna (n = 36,350 doses) and Johnson & Johnson - J&J (n = 1,745 doses), and among individuals receiving one of 10 FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (n = 771,805 doses). Comparing the incidence rates of CVST in 30-day time windows before and after vaccination, we found no statistically significant differences for the COVID-19 vaccines or any other vaccines studied in this population. In total, we observed 3 cases of CVST within the 30 days following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination (2 females, 1 male; Ages (years): [79, 80, 84]), including one individual with a prior history of thrombosis and another individual with recent trauma in the past 30 days. We did not observe any cases of CVST among the patients receiving Moderna or J&J vaccines in this study population. We further found the baseline CVST incidence in the study population between 2017 and 2021 to be 45 to 98 per million patient years. Overall, this real-world evidence-based study highlights that CVST is rare and is not significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there is a need for a concerted international effort to monitor EHR data across diverse patient populations and to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms leading to these rare clotting events.",23/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.20.21255806,Venky Soundararajan,nference,medrxiv,0,0,,

SettingChennai, a densely populated metropolitan city in Southern India, was one of the five cities which contributed to more than half of the COVID-19 cases in India.

ParticipantsWe collected the de-identified line list of all the 192,450 COVID-19 case-patients reported from 17 March to 31 October 2020 in Chennai and their contacts for the analysis. We defined a COVID-19 case-patient based on the RT-PCR positive test in one of the Government approved labs.

Outcome measuresThe primary outcomes of interest were incidence of COVID-19 per million population, case fatality ratio, deaths per million and the effective reproduction number (Rt). We also analysed the indicators for surveillance, testing, contact tracing and isolation.

ResultsOf the 192,450 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 case-patients reported in Chennai from 17 March-31 October 2020, 114,889 (60%) were males. The highest incidence was 41,064 per million population among the 61-80 years. The incidence peaked during June 2020 at 5239 per million and declined to 3,627 per million in October 2020. The city reported 3,543 deaths, with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 1.8% and the crude death rate was 431 per million. When lockdown began, Rt was high (4.2) in March and fluctuated from April to June 2020. The Rt dropped below one by the first week of July and remained so until October 2020, even with the relaxation of restrictions

ConclusionThe combination of public health strategies controlled the COVID-19 epidemic in a large, densely populated city in India. We recommend continuing the interventions to prevent resurgence, even as vaccination is being rolled out.

StrengthsO_LIWe did a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 strategies and outcome in a large, densely populated metropolitan city in India.
C_LIO_LIWe documented that the community-centric public health strategies were feasible and effective in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak even in a large, thickly populated city

Depending on the chosen control strategy, the COVID-19 spreading behavior slowed down or approximately stopped for a defined time range. This phenomenon is called saturation effect and can be described by saturation models: E.g. a fundamental approach is Verhulst (1838). The model parameter allows the interpretation of the spreading speed (growth) and the saturation effect in a sound way. This paper shows results of a research study of the COVID-19 spreading behavior and saturation effects depending on different pandemic control strategies in different countries and time phases based on Johns Hopkins University data base (2020). The study contains the analyzing of saturation effects related to short time periods, e.g. possible caused by lockdown strategies, geographical influences and medical prevention activities. The research study is focusing on reference countries like Germany, Japan, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland and Israel.",23/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.22.21255952,Stefan Bracke,"University of Wuppertal, Germany",medrxiv,0,0,,
259,25795,Quarantine and testing strategies for safe pandemic travel,"BackgroundStrict travel restrictions have been imposed by numerous countries and have contributed to the large socioeconomic burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. The long quarantines that are applicable to contacts of cases may be excessive for travel policy.

MethodsWe developed an approach to evaluate imminent countrywide COVID-19 infections after 0-14-day quarantine and testing compared to travel ban, identifying the minimum quarantine duration for travelers from an origin country that did not increase the infection rate within the destination country as ""sufficient."" We integrated prevalence, daily incidence, vaccine coverage, immunity, age demographics, and travel flow for 31 European countries.

FindingsFor the vast majority of country pairs, no testing, testing alone, or short quarantine were as effective as travel ban. Sufficient quarantines were predominantly influenced by disease prevalence and travel asymmetries. Analysis of the widespread variant of concern B.1.1.7 yielded similar results as for nonspecific viral incidence, whereas application to the heterogeneously distributed B.1.351variant required longer, more idiosyncratic quarantines. Adaptation to the European Union traffic-light risk stratification provided a simplified policy tool. Hospitalization rates were far more sensitive to countrywide vaccination coverage than to the duration of the travel quarantine or to the country of origin. Our analytical approach provides rigorous guidance for travel policy during early and late phases of pandemic disease.

InterpretationFor nearly half of country pairs analysed, travel can be permitted in the absence of quarantine and testing without increasing short-term infection rates; for the majority of origin-destination pairs requiring controls, a three-day or shorter quarantine with RT-PCR or antigen testing on exit suffices. These travel quarantine durations are substantially shorter than those specified for traced contacts.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSEvidence from early in the pandemic indicates that border closures at the epicenter slowed global dissemination of COVID-19. As community transmission became established in many nations, studies have suggested that the benefit of strict border closures in mitigating the transmission of disease from travellers diminished. Research for community settings has shown that testing later during quarantine, rather than upon entry to, can substantially shorten the duration of quarantine needed to reduce post-quarantine transmission.

Added value of this studyNo study has evaluated the effect of quarantine durations in the context of international travel, or for specific pairs of origin and destination countries. By accounting for prevalence, daily incidence, vaccine coverage, immunity, age demographics, and travel flow between countries, we quantified the contribution of travel towards imminent infections in the destination country under different quarantine and testing strategies. We developed a framework to identify quarantine and testing strategies that enable travel from specific origins without increasing their infection and hospitalization rates in the destinations. For travel between 31 European countries, our results demonstrate that there are often less burdensome quarantine and testing strategies that can serve as equivalent alternatives to strict border closure. Specifically, these sufficient quarantine durations are especially dependent on COVID-19 prevalence within the two countries and the asymmetry in the travel flow. Using data on variants of concern, we found whether a border control strategy is sufficient to limit variant spread depends strongly on their geographical distribution. Our framework is applicable not just for international travel, but can be applied at any spatial or population scale within which movement restrictions could feasibly be implemented.

Implications of all available evidenceTravel quarantine and testing strategies can effectively mitigate importation and onward transmission within the country. Identifying these sufficient strategies can allow countries to permit travel with other countries, without risking an increase in their short-term infection rates. Once community transmission of disease or disease variants is ongoing, the long-term epidemic trend within the destination country is more apt to be determined by other disease control measures, e.g., contact tracing, vaccination, and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Together, travel quarantine and other related control measures can mitigate the risk of transmission between countries; limiting the threat of variants of concern.",07/05/2021,10.1101/2021.04.25.21256082,Jeffrey P.

262,26022,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Healthcare Workers in a United States Medical Center,"BackgroundThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prioritized healthcare personnel for the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States to keep critical healthcare infrastructure open and functioning, but vaccine hesitancy may limit vaccine uptake.

ObjectiveTo evaluate vaccine intentions among healthcare workers eligible for COVID-19 vaccination and explore differences by sociodemographic and occupational characteristics.

DesignFrom February 1-15, 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional, opt-in online survey at a Midwest U.S. academic healthcare center that began vaccinating employees in December 2020.

ParticipantsThe entire employee workforce of the study site was eligible.

Main MeasuresCOVID-19 vaccination intention, categorized as Received/Scheduled/ASAP, Not Now, and Not Ever. Logistic regression models to assess the relationship between demographic and occupational characteristics and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination.

Key ResultsMost participants (n=11,387, of 39,259 individual and group email accounts invited) had received or were scheduled to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (n=9081, 79.8%) or planned to receive it as soon as possible (n=546, 4.8%), while fewer were hesitant (Not Now, n=954, 8.4%; Not Ever, n=369, 3.2%). In multivariable logistic regression models predicting vaccine intention, physicians (aOR 22.2, 9.1-54.3), trainees (aOR 5.9, 3.0-11.4), and nurse practitioners/nurse midwives/physician assistants (aOR 1.9, 1.2-3.0) were significantly more likely to demonstrate vaccine acceptance, compared to nurses, whereas other clinical staff were significantly less likely (aOR 0.8, 0.6-0.9). Prior infection with COVID-19, gender, race/ethnicity, and age were all significantly associated with vaccine intention. Overall, 29.6% reported at least one concern about COVID-19 vaccination.

ConclusionsIn a large, diverse sample of healthcare workers, over 11% delayed COVID-19 vaccination when it was available to them, with notable variation in vaccine hesitancy across professional roles and demographic groups. Our findings suggest immediate opportunities to empathetically engage those with COVID-19 vaccine concerns and optimize vaccine coverage across our healthcare system.",30/04/2021,10.1101/2021.04.29.21256186,Michelle H.

264,26130,Tracking the emergence of disparities in the subnational spread of COVID-19 in Brazil using an online application for real-time data visualisation.,"BackgroundBrazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with over 14 million cases and 375,000 deaths reported. Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures.

MethodsHere we describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence.

FindingsAfter an initial introduction in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to Northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 3.8 days (95% CI:1.8-5.8) for each 10% increase in social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset.

InterpretationThis study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

FundingThis project was supported by a Medical Research Council-Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) CADDE partnership award (MR/S0195/1 and FAPESP 18/14389-0)

Research in context panelO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSBrazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. The spread of the epidemic across the country has been highly heterogeneous and this unfolding pattern can potentially reveal important real-time information about epidemiological risk factors and the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions. A variety of COVID-19 data dashboards provide real time insights, but few present data down to local levels or perform the data standardisation procedures necessary to reveal the true patterns of spread and the factors driving the differences in severity between places. Several retrospective analyses using reported case and population-based serological datasets have been performed, but only for specific areas of Brazil and only at particular times in the epidemic. As a result, such studies have, unsurprisingly, found conflicting risk factors e.g. socio-economic status has gone from a risk to a protective factor.

Added value of this studyThis study describes the development of the COVID-19 Local Information Comparison (CLIC Brazil) app (https://cmmid.github.io/visualisations/lacpt) and demonstrates the scientific insights possible with such local, standardised, real-time platforms. The app provides access to standardised case and death time-series of epidemic data for each of the 5570 municipalities in Brazil and is updated daily.

We found that the COVID-19 epidemic established earliest in municipalities with higher population density, higher social development index (SDI) and greater percentage of residences with piped sanitation, and latest in areas geographically distant from the main population centres. By looking at local early epidemic progression rates (Rt) we were able to map heterogeneity in transmission intensity across Brazil and show its correlation with socioeconomic and connectivity measures.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe app provides a useful tool for comparing epidemic severity between places and over time at a finer grained spatial resolution. It shows how rapid insights can be gained into the unfolding risk factors of epidemics which is increasingly important when such risk factors rapidly evolve due to non-pharmaceutical interventions, emergence of new variants and vaccination.

Brazil is currently experiencing a second wave of the epidemic, driven by the emergence of a more transmissible variant (P1). Continual tracking of this phase of the epidemic using methods demonstrated in our analyses will be important to assess similarities and differences in the spatial spread of different COVID-19 epidemic waves.",25/05/2021,10.1101/2021.04.30.21256386,Paul Mee,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,medrxiv,0,0,,
265,26154,Does the Data Tell the True Story? A Modelling Study of Early COVID-19 Pandemic Suppression and Mitigation Strategies in Ghana,"This paper uses publicly available data and various statistical models to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and other disease parameters for the early COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Ghana. We also test the effectiveness of government imposition of public health measures to reduce the risk of transmission and impact of the pandemic, especially in the early phase. R0 is estimated from the statistical model as 3.21 using a 0.147 estimated growth rate [95% C.I.: 0.137-0.157] and a 15-day time to recovery after COVID-19 infection. This estimate of the initial R0 is consistent with others reported in the literature from other parts of Africa, China and Europe. Our results also indicate that COVID-19 transmission reduced consistently in Ghana after the imposition of public health interventions - such as border restrictions, intra-city movement, quarantine and isolation - during the first phase of the pandemic from March to May 2020. However, the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) beyond mid-May 2020 does not represent the true situation given there was not a consistent testing regime in place. This is also confirmed by our Jack-knife bootstrap estimates which show that the positivity rate over-estimates the true incidence rate from mid-May 2020. Given concerns about virus mutations, delays in vaccination and a possible new wave of the pandemic, there is a need for systematic testing of a representative sample of the population to monitor the reproduction number. There is also an urgent need to increase the availability of testing for the general population to enable early detection, isolation and treatment of infected individuals to reduce progression to severe disease and mortality.",05/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.02.21256473,Theophilus Acheampong,University of Aberdeen,medrxiv,0,0,,
266,26192,Estimating vaccine efficacy against transmission via effect on viral load,"Determining policies to end the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will require an understanding of the efficacy and effectiveness (hereafter, efficacy) of vaccines. Beyond the efficacy against severe disease and symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, understanding vaccine efficacy against transmission will help model epidemic trajectory and determine appropriate control measures. Recent studies have proposed using random virologic testing in individual randomized controlled trials to improve estimation of vaccine efficacy against infection. We propose to further use the viral load measures from these tests to estimate efficacy against transmission. This estimation requires a model of the relationship between viral load and transmissibility and assumptions about the vaccine effect on transmission and the progress of the epidemic. We describe these key assumptions, potential violations of them, and solutions that can be implemented to mitigate these violations. Assessing these assumptions and implementing this random sampling, with viral load measures, will enable better estimation of the crucial measure of vaccine efficacy against transmission.",06/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.03.21256556,Lee Kennedy-Shaffer,Vassar College,medrxiv,0,0,,
268,26216,Short-term effects of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination on physiological measures: a prospective study,"BackgroundClinical trial guidelines for assessing the safety of vaccines, including the FDA criteria, are primarily based on subjective, self-reported questionnaires. Despite the tremendous technological advances in recent years, objective, continuous assessment of physiological measures post-vaccination is rarely performed.

MethodsTo evaluate the short-term effects of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine on physiological measures, we conducted a prospective observational study during the mass vaccination campaign in Israel. 160 individuals >18 years who were not previously found to be COVID-19 positive and who received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine between 1 January, 2021, and 13 March, 2021 were equipped with a chest-patch sensor and a dedicated mobile application. The chest-patch sensor continuously measured 13 physiological vitals one day before the inoculation (baseline), for four days: heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate variability, stroke volume, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and body temperature. The mobile application collected daily self-reported questionnaires starting one day before the inoculation, for 15 days on local and systemic reactions, sleep quality, stress levels, physical activity, and mood levels.

FindingsWithin the first 48 hours post-vaccination, we identified significant changes (p-value <0.05) in nearly all 13 chest-patch indicators compared to their baseline levels. 48.5% (n=78) reported no local or systemic reaction. Nevertheless, we identified considerable changes in chest-patch indicators during the first 48 hours post-vaccination also in this group of presumably asymptomatic participants. Within three days from vaccination, these measures returned to baseline levels in both groups, further supporting the safety of the vaccine.

InterpretationOur work underscores the importance of obtaining objective physiological data in addition to self-reported questionnaires when performing clinical trials, particularly in ones conducted in very short time frames.

270,26432,A model to analyze rideshare data to surveil novel strains of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe emergence of novel, potentially vaccine-resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2 poses a serious risk to public health. The interactions between passengers and drivers facilitated by rideshare platforms such as Uber are, essentially, a series of partially standardized, random experiments of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Rideshare companies share data with government health agencies, but no statistical method is available to aggregate these data for the systematic study of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

MethodsWe develop a proof-of-concept model for the analysis of data from rideshare interactions merged with COVID-19 diagnosis records. Using simulated data with rideshare volumes, disease prevalence, and diagnosis rates based on a large US city, we use the model to test hypotheses about the emergence of viral strains and their transmission characteristics in the presence of non-pharmaceutical interventions and superspreaders.

FindingsData from 10 simulated trials of SARS-CoV-2 propagation within the Los Angeles rideshare network resulted in an average of 190,387.1 potentially infectious rideshare interactions. Assuming access to data on 25% of the total estimated infections (Partial Reporting), these interactions resulted in an average of 409.0 diagnosed rideshare infections given our transmission model assumptions. For each of the 10 simulated trials, analysis given Partial Reporting could consistently differentiate between a baseline strain and an emergent, more infectious viral strain, enabling hypothesis testing about transmission characteristics.

InterpretationSimulated evaluation of a novel statistical model suggests that rideshare data combined with COVID-19 diagnosis data have the potential to automate continued surveillance of emergent novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 and their transmission characteristics.",12/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.07.21256856,David Scheinker,Stanford University,medrxiv,0,0,,
271,26433,Impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from U.S. states,"Governments worldwide are implementing mass vaccination programs in an effort to end the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the approved vaccines exhibited high efficacies in randomized controlled trials1,2, their population effectiveness in the real world remains less clear, thus casting uncertainty over the prospects for herd immunity. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination program and predicted the path to herd immunity in the U.S. Using data from 12 October 2020 to 7 March 2021, we estimated that vaccination reduced the total number of new cases by 4.4 million (from 33.0 to 28.6 million), prevented approximately 0.12 million hospitalizations (from 0.89 to 0.78 million), and decreased the population infection rate by 1.34 percentage points (from 10.10% to 8.76%). We then built a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with vaccination to predict herd immunity. Our model predicts that if the average vaccination pace between January and early March 2021 (2.08 doses per 100 people per week) is maintained, the U.S. can achieve herd immunity by the last week of July 2021, with a cumulative vaccination coverage of 60.2%. Herd immunity could be achieved earlier with a faster vaccination pace, lower vaccine hesitancy, or higher vaccine effectiveness. These findings improve our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 vaccines and can inform future public health policies regarding vaccination, especially in countries with ongoing vaccination programs.",12/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.08.21256892,Hanwei Huang,City University of Hong Kong,medrxiv,0,0,,
275,26743,Pregnancy and birth outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with significant maternal morbidity and increased rates of preterm birth. For this reason, COVID-19 vaccine administration in pregnancy has been endorsed by multiple professional societies including ACOG and SMFM despite exclusion of pregnant women from initial clinical trials of vaccine safety and efficacy. However, to date little data exists regarding outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant patients.

Study DesignA comprehensive vaccine registry was combined with a delivery database for an integrated healthcare system to create a delivery cohort including vaccinated patients. Maternal sociodemographic data were examined univariately for factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Pregnancy and birth outcomes were analyzed, including a composite measure of maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications, the Adverse Outcome Index.

ResultsOf 2002 patients in the delivery cohort, 140 (7.0%) received a COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and 212 (10.6%) experienced a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. The median gestational age at first vaccination was 32 weeks (range 13 6/7-40 4/7), and patients vaccinated during pregnancy were less likely than unvaccinated patients to experience COVID-19 infection prior to delivery (1.4% (2/140) vs. 11.3% (210/1862)) P<0.001No maternal COVID-19 infections occurred after vaccination during pregnancy.

Factors significantly associated with increased likelihood of vaccination included older age, higher level of maternal education, lower pre-pregnancy BMI, and use of infertility treatment for the current pregnancy. Tobacco or other substance use, Hispanic ethnicity, and higher gravidity were associated with a lower likelihood of vaccination. No significant difference in the composite adverse outcome (5.0% (7/140) vs. 4.9% (91/1862) P=0.95) or other maternal or neonatal complications, including thromboembolic events and preterm birth, was observed in vaccinated mothers compared to unvaccinated patients.

ConclusionsVaccinated pregnant women in this birth cohort were less likely to experience COVID-19 infection compared to unvaccinated pregnant patients, and COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased pregnancy or delivery complications. Significant sociodemographic disparities in vaccine uptake and/or access were observed among pregnant patients, and future efforts should focus on outreach to low-uptake populations.",18/05/2021,10.1101/2021.05.17.21257337,Regan N Theiler,Mayo clinic,medrxiv,0,0,,

280,26915,Towards Internationally standardised humoral Immune Correlates of Protection from SARS CoV 2 infection and COVID-19 disease,"Precision monitoring of antibody responses during the COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly important during large scale vaccine rollout and rise in prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC). Equally important is defining Correlates of Protection (CoP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Data from epidemiological studies and vaccine trials identified virus neutralising antibodies (Nab) and SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific (notably RBD, and S) binding antibodies as candidate CoP. In this study, we used the World Health Organisation (WHO) international standard to benchmark neutralising antibody responses and a large panel of binding antibody assays to compare convalescent sera obtained from: a) COVID-19 patients; b) SARS-CoV-2 seropositive healthcare workers (HCW) and c) seronegative HCW. The ultimate aim of this study, was to identify biomarkers of humoral immunity that could be used as candidate CoP in internationally accepted unitage. Whenever suitable, the antibody levels of the samples studied were expressed in International Units (INU) for virus neutralisation assays or International Binding Antibody Units (BAU) for ELISA tests. In this work we used commercial and non-commercial antibody binding assays; a lateral flow test for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG / IgM; a high throughput multiplexed particle flow cytometry assay for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) proteins); a multiplex antigen semi-automated immuno-blotting assay measuring IgM, IgA and IgG; a pseudotyped microneutralisation test (pMN) and electroporation-dependent neutralisation assay (EDNA). Our results indicate that overall, severe COVID-19 patients showed statistically significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibodies (average 1029 IU/ml) than those observed in seropositive HCW with mild or asymptomatic infections (379 IU/ml) and that clinical severity scoring, based on WHO guidelines was tightly correlated with neutralisation and RBD / S binding assays.

281,27000,"Monoclonal Antibody Treatment, Prophylaxis and Vaccines Combined to Reduce SARS CoV-2 Spread","BackgroundAntiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed for treatment of COVID-19 reduce the magnitude and duration of viral shedding and can thus potentially contribute to reducing transmission of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, use of these mAbs in combination with a vaccine program has not been considered in public health strategic planning.

MethodsWe developed an agent-based model to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the US population during an aggressive phase of the pandemic (October 2020 to April 2021), and simulated the effects on infections and mortality of combining mAbs as treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a vaccine program plus non-pharmaceutical interventions. We also interrogated the impact of rapid diagnostic testing, increased mAb supply, and vaccine rollout.

FindingsAllocation of mAbs as PEP or targeting those [&ge;]65 years provided the greatest incremental benefits relative to vaccine in averting infections and deaths, by up to 17% and 41%, respectively. Rapid testing, facilitating earlier diagnosis and mAb use, amplified these benefits. The model was sensitive to mAb supply; doubling supply further reduced infections and mortality, by up to two-fold, relative to vaccine. mAbs continued to provide incremental benefits even as proportion of the vaccinated population increased.

InterpretationUse of anti-viral mAbs as treatment and PEP in combination with a vaccination program would substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pandemic burden. These results may help guide resource allocation and patient management decisions for COVID-19 and can also be used to inform public health policy for current and future pandemic preparedness.

288,27416,The Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination on California's Return to Normalcy,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected nearly 3.7 million and killed 61,722 Californians, as of May 22, 2021. Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been instrumental in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. How- ever, as we ease restrictions, widespread implementation of COVID- 19 vaccines is essential to prevent its resurgence. In this work, we addressed the adequacy and deficiency of vaccine uptake within California and the possibility and severity of resurgence of COVID-19 as restrictions are lifted given the current vaccination rates. We implemented a real-time Bayesian data assimilation approach to provide projections of incident cases and deaths in California following the reopening of its economy on June 15, 2021. We implemented scenarios that vary vaccine uptake prior to reopening, and transmission rates and effective population sizes following the reopening. For comparison purposes, we adopted a baseline scenario using the current vaccination rates, which projects a total 11,429 cases and 429 deaths in a 15-day period after reopening. We used posterior estimates based on CA historical data to provide realistic model parameters after reopening. When the transmission rate is increased after reopening, we projected an increase in cases by 21.8% and deaths by 4.4% above the baseline after reopening. When the effective population is increased after reopening, we observed an increase in cases by 51.8% and deaths by 12.3% above baseline. A 30% reduction in vaccine uptake alone has the potential to increase cases and deaths by 35% and 21.6%, respectively. Conversely, increasing vaccine uptake by 30% could decrease cases and deaths by 26.1% and 17.9%, respectively. As California unfolds its plan to reopen its economy on June 15, 2021, it is critical that social distancing and public behavior changes continue to be promoted, particularly in communities with low vaccine uptake. The Centers of Disease Controls (CDC) recommendation to ease mask- wearing for fully vaccinated individuals despite major inequities in vaccine uptake in counties across the state highlights some of the logistical challenges that society faces as we enthusiastically phase out of this pandemic.",04/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.01.21258187,Maria L Daza-Torres,"University of California, Davis",medrxiv,0,0,,
289,27391,Association of Convalescent Plasma Treatment with Reduced Mortality and Improved Clinical Trajectory in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Community Setting,"BackgroundConvalescent plasma (CP) quickly emerged as one of the first investigational treatment options for COVID-19. Evidence supporting CP for treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been inconclusive, leading to conflicting recommendations regarding its use. The primary objective was to perform a comparative effectiveness study of CP for all-cause, in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsThe matched, multicenter, electronic health records-based, retrospective cohort study included 44,770 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in one of 176 HCA Healthcare-affiliated community hospitals across the United States from March 2 to October 7, 2020. Coarsened exact matching (1:k) was employed resulting in a sample of 3,774 CP and 10,687 comparison patients.

ResultsExamining mortality using a shared frailty model and controlling for concomitant medications, calendar date of admission, and days from admission to transfusion demonstrated a significant association of CP with lower risk of mortality compared to the comparison group (aHR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86, p<0.001). Examination of patient risk trajectories, represented by 400 clinico-demographic features from our Real-Time Risk Model (RTRM), indicated that patients who received CP recovered more quickly. The time from admission to CP transfusion was significantly associated with risk of mortality and stratification revealed that CP within 3 days after admission, but not 4-7 days, was associated with a significant reduction in mortality risk (aHR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.47-0.60, p<0.001). CP serology level was inversely associated with mortality when controlling for interaction with days to transfusion (HR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.997-0.999, p = 0.013) but was not significant in a univariable analysis.

ConclusionUtilizing this large, diverse, multicenter cohort, we demonstrate that CP is significantly associated with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality. These observations demonstrate the utility of real-world evidence and suggest the need for further evaluation prior to abandoning CP as a viable therapy for COVID-19.

Research in Context

Evidence before this studyDiscrepant reports of the efficacy of various treatments for COVID-19, including convalescent plasma (CP), emerged from a rapidly evolving political and interventional landscape of the pandemic. Furthermore, clinical interpretations of this discordant data led to underuse, overuse and misuse of certain interventions, often ignoring mechanistic context altogether. CP has been utilized in prior pandemics/epidemics to introduce antibodies to elicit an immune response during the viral phase of infection. Thus, CP received early priority for emergency use and randomized trial engagement. Initially, the United States had issued individual emergency investigational new drug (eIND) use for CP and initiated its expanded access protocol (EAP) to monitor its safety profile and to allow broader access. This effectively restricted access to those with severe disease, which is not mechanistically aligned with targeting the viral phase. Many randomized control trials (RCTs) were being setup for testing efficacy of CP in the inpatient setting and, to a lesser extent, the outpatient setting. Some trial designs focused on severe disease and others on less severe. United States RCTs had additional enrollment challenges due to competing patient access to EAP. All studies were limited by supply and demand due to regional outbreaks and to the shear operational effort of coordinating donations, sampling, serology testing, ordering, and distribution.

To date, most matched studies and RCTs around the globe have shown a trend of CP providing survival benefit, but all had relatively small cohorts except the RECOVERY trial, which failed to show a benefit with CP. Results ranged from no significant effect to 56% reduction in mortality with the latter coming out of a multisite RCT based in New York and Rio De Janeiro. There has been a minimum of nine matched control studies and seven randomized control trials evaluating convalescent plasma.

We frequently assessed World Health Organization (WHO), United Stated Food and Drug Administration (FDA), BARDA/Mayo Clinic led EAP, and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) resources as well as queried both preprint archives (MedRXIV & SSRN) and PubMed with the search terms ""retrospective"", ""convalescent plasma"", ""randomized"", ""trial"", ""comparative effect"", ""COVID"", ""hospital"", ""in-hospital"", ""hospitalized"" and ""mortality"" to ensure we were considering the most recent methodology and results generated for CP. The last search was performed on May 14, 2021. No date restrictions or language filters were applied.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this study is the largest and most geographically diverse of its kind to comprehensively evaluate and confirm the beneficial association of CP with all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our data provides context to optimal delivery and validates recent trends in the literature showing CP benefit. There is a dose-response effect with CP antibody levels and we demonstrate that sooner really is better in accordance with the mechanisms of viral clearance and immune regulation. Finally, this is all done in the context of a diverse community setting in one of the largest hospital systems in the United States.

Implications of all the available evidenceAs novel, more virulent and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge around the globe and as reports of post-vaccine ""breakthrough"" infections and vaccine hesitancy increase, there is a renewed motivation to identify effective treatments for hospitalized patients. The data presented here, along with a growing body of evidence from matched-control studies and RCTs, demonstrate that further evaluation is required prior to abandoning CP as an effective intervention in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",04/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.02.21258190,Shanna A.

291,27525,Revealing public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines using Twitter data in the United States: a spatiotemporal perspective,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a large, initially uncontrollable, public health crisis both in the US and across the world, with experts looking to vaccines as the ultimate mechanism of defense. The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines by investigating the spatiotemporal trends of their sentiment and emotion towards vaccines, as well as how such trends relate to popular topics on Twitter in the US.

MethodsWe collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the US from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified three phases along the pandemic timeline with the significant changes of public sentiment and emotion, further linking to eleven key events and major topics as the potential drivers to induce such changes via cloud mapping of keywords and topic modelling.

ResultsAn increasing trend of positive sentiment in parallel with the decrease of negative sentiment are generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards vaccines. The overall tendency of the eight types of emotion implies the trustiness and anticipation of the public to vaccination, accompanied by the mixture of fear, sadness and anger. Critical social/international events and/or the announcements of political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on the public opinion on vaccines. These factors, along with important topics and manual reading of popular posts on eleven key events, help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis.

ConclusionsThe analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics and promote the confidence of individuals within a certain region or community, towards vaccines.",07/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.02.21258233,Wei Luo,National University of Singapore,medrxiv,0,0,,
292,27480,"Safety of COVID-19 vaccines, their components or their platforms for pregnant women: A rapid review","BackgroundPregnant women with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness as well as adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Many countries are vaccinating or considering vaccinating pregnant women with limited available data about the safety of this strategy. Early identification of safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines, including their components, or their technological platforms is therefore urgently needed.

MethodsWe conducted a rapid systematic review, as the first phase of an ongoing full systematic review, to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women, including their components, and their technological platforms (whole virus, protein, viral vector or nucleic acid) used in other vaccines, following the Cochrane methods and the PRISMA statement for reporting (PROSPERO-CRD42021234185).

We searched literature databases, COVID-19 and pregnancy registries from inception February 2021 without time or language restriction and explored the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews retrieved. We selected studies of any methodological design that included at least 50 pregnant women or pregnant animals exposed to the vaccines that were selected for review by the COVAX MIWG in August 2020 or their components or platforms included in the COVID-19 vaccines, and evaluated adverse events during pregnancy and the neonatal period.

Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through the COVIDENCE web software and performed the data extraction through a previously piloted online extraction form. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

ResultsWe identified 6768 records, 256 potentially eligible studies were assessed by full-text, and 37 clinical and non-clinical studies (38 reports, involving 2,397,715 pregnant women and 56 pregnant animals) and 12 pregnancy registries were included.

Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries. The most frequent study design was cohort studies (n=21), followed by surveillance studies, randomized controlled trials, and registry analyses. Most studies (76%) allowed comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women (n=25) or animals (n=3) and reported exposures during the three trimesters of pregnancy.

The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines (n=24), followed by aluminum-based adjuvants (n=11). Aluminum phosphate was used in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Fusion candidate vaccines (n=3) and Tdap vaccines (n=3). Different aluminum-based adjuvants were used in hepatitis vaccines. The replication-deficient simian adenovirus ChAdOx1 was used for a Rift Valley fever vaccine. Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines that also used lipid nanoparticles. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03) - corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns.

ConclusionThis rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines that were selected for review by the COVAX MIWG or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines. However, the need for further data on several vaccine platforms and components is warranted given their novelty. Our findings support current WHO guidelines recommending that pregnant women may consider receiving COVID-19 vaccines, particularly if they are at high risk of exposure or have comorbidities that enhance the risk of severe disease.",06/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.03.21258283,Agustin Ciapponi,"Instituto de Efectividad Clinica y Sanitaria (IECS-CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina",medrxiv,0,0,,
296,27775,A Meta-Analysis of Influenza Vaccination Following Correspondence: Considerations for COVID-19,"BackgroundHigh vaccination rates are needed to protect against influenza and to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities need to know if supplementing mass communications with direct correspondence to the community would increase uptake.

ObjectivesThe primary objective is to determine if sending a single written message directly to individuals increases influenza vaccine uptake, and a secondary objective is to identify any identified content shown to increase influenza vaccine uptake.

MethodsPubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science were searched for English language RCTs testing a single correspondence for members of the community in OECD countries to obtain influenza vaccination. A meta-analysis with inverse-variance, random-effects modelling was used to estimate a mean, weighted risk ratio effect size measure of vaccine uptake. Studies were quality assessed and analysis was undertaken to account for potential publication bias.

ResultsTwenty-two randomized controlled trials were included covering 37 interventions. Of the 37 interventions, 32 (86%) report an increase in influenza vaccination rates. A formal meta-analysis shows that sending a single written message increases influenza vaccine uptake by 18% (RR = 1.18, 95%CI [1.13-1.22], Z = 8.56, p < .001) relative to the no contact comparator group. Analysis shows that the intervention is effective across correspondence type, age group, time, and location, and after allowing for risk of publication bias.

LimitationsThe review was restricted to English language publications, and the generalizability of results across the OECD may be questioned.

Conclusions and implicationsThe implication for public health authorities organizing vaccination programs for influenza, and arguably also for COVID-19, is that sending written vaccination correspondence to members of the community is likely to increase uptake.

The disease is characterized by immune dysregulation and cytokine storm. Cyclosporine A (CSA) is a calcineurin inhibitor that modulates cytokine production and may have direct antiviral properties against coronaviruses. To test whether a short course of treatment was safe in COVID-19 patients, we treated 10 hospitalized, oxygen requiring, non-critically ill patients with CSA at a starting dose of 9mg/kg/day. Five patients experienced adverse events, none were serious, and transaminitis was most common. No subject enrolled in this trial required intensive care unit (ICU)-level care and all patients were discharged alive from the hospital. Further, CSA treatment was associated with significant reductions in serum cytokines and chemokines important in COVID-19 hyper-inflammation, including CXCL10. In conclusion, short courses of CSA appear safe and feasible in COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen and therefore, may be a useful adjunct in resource-poor or resource-limited health care settings.",15/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.10.21258714,Emily A Blumberg,University of Pennsylvania,medrxiv,0,0,,
298,27796,Assessing the level and determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence in Kenya,"The government of Kenya has launched a phased rollout of COVID-19 vaccination. A major barrier is vaccine hesitancy; the refusal or delay of accepting vaccination. This study evaluated the level and determinants of vaccine hesitancy in Kenya. We conducted a cross-sectional study administered through a phone-based survey in February 2021 in four counties of Kenya. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify individual perceived risks and influences, context-specific factors, and vaccine-specific issues associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Kenya was high: 60.1%. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy included: older age, lower education level, perceived difficulty in adhering to government regulations on COVID-19 prevention, less adherence to wearing of face masks, not having ever been tested for COVID-19, no reported socio-economic loss as a result of COVID public-health restriction measures, and concerns regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness. There is a need for the prioritization of interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccine confidence as part of the vaccine roll-out plan. These messaging and/or interventions should be holistic to include the value of other public health measures, be focused and targeted to specific groups, raise awareness on the risks of COVID-19 and effectively communicate the benefits and risks of vaccines.",16/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.11.21258775,Stacey Orangi,"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Nairobi, Kenya",medrxiv,0,0,,
299,28016,Mild Adverse Events of Sputnik V Vaccine Extracted from Russian Language Telegram Posts via BERT Deep Learning Model,"BackgroundThere is a limited amount of data on the COVID-19 vector vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) safety profile. Previous infodemiology studies showed that social media discourse could be analyzed to assess the most concerning adverse events (AE) caused by drugs.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate mild AEs of Sputnik V based on a participatory trial conducted on Telegram in the Russian language. We compared AEs extracted from Telegram with other limited databases on Sputnik V and other COVID-19 vaccines. We explored symptom co-occurrence patterns and determined how counts of administered doses, age, gender, and sequence of shots could confound the reporting of AEs.

Materials and MethodsWe collected a unique dataset consisting of 11,515 self-reported Sputnik V vaccine AEs posted on the Telegram group, and we utilized natural language processing methods to extract AEs. Specifically, we performed multi-label classifications using the deep neural language model BERT ""DeepPavlov"", which we pre-trained on a Russian language corpus and applied to the Telegram messages. The resulting AUC score was 0.991. We chose symptom classes that represented the following AEs: fever, pain, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headache, insomnia, lymph node enlargement, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and diarrhea.

ResultsThe results of the retrospective analysis showed that females reported more AEs than males (1.2-fold, P<.001). In addition, there were more AEs from the first dose than from the second dose (1.13-fold, P<.001), and the number of AEs decreased with age ({beta} = .05 per year, P<.001). The results also showed that Sputnik V AEs were more similar to other vector vaccines (132 units) compared with mRNA ones (241 units) according to the average Euclidean distance between the vectors of AE frequencies. Elderly Telegram users reported significantly more (5.6-fold on average) systemic AEs than their peers, according to the results of the phase III clinical trials published in The Lancet. However, the AEs reported in Telegram posts were consistent (Pearson correlation r=.94, P=.02) with those reported in the Argentinian post-marketing AE registry.

ConclusionAfter receiving the Sputnik V vaccination, Telegram users complained about pain (47%), fever (47%), fatigue (34%), and headache (25%). The results showed that the AE profile of Sputnik V was comparable with other COVID-19 vaccines. Examining the sentinel properties of participatory trials (which is subject to self-reporting biases) could still provide meaningful information about pharmaceutics, especially if only a limited amount of information on AEs is provided by producers.",22/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.14.21258875,Andrzej Jarynowski,Interdisciplinary Research Institute in Wroclaw,medrxiv,0,0,,
301,27855,Survival of vaccine-induced human milk SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA immunoglobulins across simulated human infant gastrointestinal digestion,"Four vaccines have been approved to date by the European Medicines Agency for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, with all four being targeted to adults over 18 years of age. One way to protect the younger population such as infants or younger children until pediatric vaccines are licensed is through passive immunity via breastfeeding. Recent evidence points to the fact that human milk contains immunoglobulins (Ig) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, both after natural infection or vaccination, but it is not known whether these antibodies can resist enzymatic degradation during digestion in the infant gastrointestinal (GI) tract or indeed protect the consumers. Here, we describe our preliminary experiments where we validated commercially available ELISA kits to detect IgA and IgG antibodies in human milk from two lactating mothers vaccinated with either the Pfizer/BioNTech or the Astra Zeneca vaccine, and the effect of a static in vitro digestion protocol on the IgA and IgG concentrations. Our data, even preliminary, provide an indication that the IgA antibodies produced after vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine resist the gastric phase but are degraded during the intestinal phase of infant digestion, whereas the IgGs are more prone to degradation in both phases of digestion. We are in the process of recruiting more individuals to further evaluate the vaccine induced immunoglobulin profile of breastmilk, and the extent to which these antibodies can resist digestion in the infant GI tract.",18/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.17.21259021,Christos Papaneophytou,University of  Nicosia,medrxiv,0,0,,

Minimal effects related to breastfeeding were reported in this cohort; 3 of 88 (3.4%) women had mastitis with 1 of 88 (1.1%) women experiencing breast engorgement. We report an incidence of lymphadenopathy in our cohort at 5 of 88 (5.7%). Reassuringly, there was no change in reported breastmilk supply after vaccination. The most common side effect was pain/redness/swelling at the injection site, which was experienced by 57 of 88 (64.8%) women. There were no serious adverse events of anaphylaxis and hospital admissions. No adverse symptoms were reported in 67 of 88 (76.1%) breastfed children.

We presumed two definitions for vaccine coverage: at least a single dose with a 12-day delay and a second dose. The study period was February, 2020 through May 16, 2021.

ResultsEstimation results indicate that vaccine coverage significantly and drastically reduced R(t) for both definitions. Results imply that increased first shot coverage by 1% point decreased R(t) by 0.5 with a 12 day delay. Moreover, increased second shot coverage by 1% point, decreased R(t) by 1 immediately.

However, limited data exist on the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic from the first wave through the second wave in India. With detailed epidemiologic data, we aimed to assess trends in incident cases and case fatality, its risk between pandemic waves in Pune, an epicenter of COVID-19 cases in India, a country with the second-largest absolute burden worldwide.

MethodsProgrammatic COVID-19 data from Pune city between the first wave (March 09th 2020-October 31st, 2020), maintenance phase (November 01st 2020-February 14th, 2021), the second wave (February 15th, 2021-May 31st, 2021) were assessed for trends of incident cases, time-to-death, and case fatality rate (CFR). In addition, Poisson regression models adjusted for age and gender were used to determine the independent effect of pandemic waves on mortality.

ResultsOf 465,192 COVID-19 cases, 162,182 (35%) were reported in the first wave, and 4,146 (2.5%) died among them; Maintenance period registered 27,517 (6%) cases with 590 (2.1%) deaths; Second wave reported 275,493 (59%) cases and 3184 (1.1%) deaths (p<0.01). The overall CFR was 1.16 per 1000 person-days (PD), which declined from 1.80 per 1000 PD during the first wave to 0.77 per 1000 PD in the second wave. The risk of death was 1.49 times higher during the first wave (adjusted case fatality rate ratio-aCFRR,1.49; 95% CI: 1.37-1.62) and 35% lower in the second wave (aCFRR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.70), compared to the maintenance phase.

InterpretationThe absolute burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths were more significant in the second wave in Pune, India; however, the CFR declined as the pandemic progressed.

308,27973,Predicting the mutational drivers of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,"SARS-CoV-2 evolution threatens vaccine- and natural infection-derived immunity, and the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. Herein we sought to predict Spike amino acid changes that could contribute to future variants of concern. We tested the importance of features comprising epidemiology, evolution, immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling. This resulted in identification of the primary biological drivers of SARS-CoV-2 intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that resistance to population-level host immunity has increasingly shaped SARS-CoV-2 evolution over time. We identified with high accuracy mutations that will spread, at up to four months in advance, across different phases of the pandemic. Behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal structure wherein epidemiological variables integrate the effects of diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to forecast mutations that will spread in the future, and characterize how these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to forecast the driver mutations that could appear in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. This modeling approach may be applied to any pathogen with genomic surveillance data, and so may address other rapidly evolving pathogens such as influenza, and unknown future pandemic viruses.",22/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.21.21259286,Amalio Telenti,Vir Biotechnology,medrxiv,0,0,,
310,28119,Report on Three Round COVID-19 Risk Blind Tests by Screening Eye-region Manifestations,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected several million people since 2019. Despite various vaccines of COVID-19 protect million people in many countries, the worldwide situations of more the asymptomatic and mutated strain discovered are urging the more sensitive COVID-19 testing in this turnaround time. Unfortunately, it is still nontrivial to develop a new fast COVID-19 screening method with the easier access and lower cost, due to the technical and cost limitations of the current testing methods in the medical resource-poor districts. On the other hand, there are more and more ocular manifestations that have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence[1]. This inspired this project. We have conducted the joint clinical research since January 2021 at the ShiJiaZhuang City, Hebei province, China, which approved by the ethics committee of The fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University. We undertake several blind tests of COVID-19 patients by Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Meantime as an important part of the ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020, we propose a new fast screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. This could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with the sustainable stable high performance in different countries and races. For this clinical trial in ShiJiaZhuang, we compare and analyze 1194 eye-region images of 115 patients, including 66 COVID-19 positive patients, 44 rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), 5 liver patients, as well as 117 healthy people. Remarkably, we consistently achieved very high testing results (> 0.94) in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our blind test of COVID-19 patients. This confirms the viability of the COVID-19 fast screening by the eye-region manifestations. Particularly and impressively, the results have the similar conclusion as the other clinical trials of the globally COVID-19 eye test program[1]. Hopefully, this series of ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test study, and potential rapid solution of fully self-performed COVID risk screening method, can be inspiring and helpful to more researchers in the world soon. Our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully self-performed, non-invasive, importantly real-time, and thus enables the continuous health surveillance. We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Our pilot experiments show that our model is ready to be usable to all kinds of surveillance scenarios, such as infrared temperature measurement device at airports and stations, or directly pushing to the target people groups smartphones as a packaged application.",25/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.23.21258626,Mengwei Gu,"Aimomics (Shanghai) Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 200433, China",medrxiv,0,0,,
311,28352,Use of recently vaccinated individuals to detect bias in test-negative case-control studies of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness,"Post-authorization observational studies play a key role in understanding COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness following the demonstration of efficacy in clinical trials. While bias due to confounding, selection bias, and misclassification can be mitigated through careful study design, unmeasured confounding is likely to remain in these observational studies. Phase III trials of COVID-19 vaccines have shown that protection from vaccination does not occur immediately, meaning that COVID-19 risk should be similar in recently vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, in the absence of confounding or other bias. Several studies have used the estimated effectiveness among recently vaccinated individuals as a negative control exposure to detect bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates. In this paper we introduce a theoretical framework to describe the interpretation of such a bias-indicator in test-negative studies, and outline assumptions that would allow the use of recently vaccinated individuals to correct bias due to unmeasured confounding.",02/07/2021,10.1101/2021.06.23.21259415,Matt D.t.

312,28148,Analysis of Host Immunological Response of Adenovirus-Based COVID-19 Vaccines,"During the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, several vaccines, including mRNA and ade-novirus vector approaches, have received emergency or full approval. However, supply chain logistics have hampered global vaccine delivery, which is impacting mass vaccination strategies. Recent studies have identified different strategies for vaccine dose administration so that supply constraints issues are diminished. These include increasing the time between consecutive doses in a two-dose vaccine regimen and reducing the dosage of the second dose. We consider both of these strategies in a mathematical modeling study of a non-replicating viral vector adenovirus vaccine in this work. We investigate the impact of different prime-boost strategies by quantifying their effects on immunological outcomes based on simple ordinary differential equations. The boost dose is administered either at a standard dose (SD) of 1000 or at a low dose (LD) of 500 or 250 vaccine particles. Simulated Second dose fractionation highlights previously shown dose-dependent features of the immune mechanism. In agreement with clinical characteristics of 175 COVID-19 recovered patients, the model predictions for either SD/SD or SD/LD regimens mainly show that by stretching the prime-boost interval until 18 or 20 weeks, the minimum promoted antibody (Nab) response is comparable with the neutralizing antibody level of COVID-19 recovered patients. The minimum stimulated antibody in SD/SD regimen is identical with the high level of clinical trial data. It is at the same range of the medium-high level of Nab in SD/LD, where the second dose is half or quarter of the standard dose.",25/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.24.21259460,Suzan Farhangsardroodi,York university,medrxiv,0,0,,
313,28299,The Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Childhood Vaccination Uptake: A Rapid Review,"BackgroundVaccines are highly effective for preventing a range of childhood infections. However, there have been concerns about an alarming decline in vaccinations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe performed a rapid review for studies that assessed childhood vaccination uptake during restrictive phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsWe found 35 published studies that compared changes in the pattern of childhood vaccinations before and during the pandemic. Thirteen were surveys; two mixed-methods surveys and interviews, three modelling studies and 17 retrospective cohort studies with historical controls. We also included ten reports by national or international agencies that had original data on vaccination uptake. Significant global disruptions to vaccine services were reported in Africa, Asia, America (including Latin America and the Caribbean) and Europe. We also found evidence of significant disruption to vaccine uptake for diphtheria tetanus pertussis, BCG, measles and polio. Countries where vaccination rates were already suboptimal had greater drops in uptake and there was evidence of smaller declines in younger children compared to older children. Children born to women who could not read and write were more likely to be incompletely immunized. Various initiatives were used to drive up vaccination rates post restrictions.

ConclusionsObstacles to the delivery of vaccination services during the Covid-19 pandemic drove down immunisation rates, especially in disadvantaged people and poorer countries.",30/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.25.21259371,Carl Heneghan,University of Oxford,medrxiv,0,0,,

Within less than a year after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines developed by several research teams were emergency-use authorized and made their way to distribution sites across the US and other countries. COVID-19 vaccines were tested in clinical trials with thousands of participants before authorization, and were administered to over a billion people across the globe in the following 6 months. Post-authorization safety monitoring was performed using pre-existing systems (such as the World Health Organizations platform VigiBase or US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS) and newly developed post-vaccination health checkers (such as V-safe in the US). Vaccinated individuals were also posting their experiences on multiple social media groups created on Facebook, Reddit, Telegram and other platforms, but the groups were often removed as ""proliferating false claims"". These forms of reporting are susceptible to biases and misclassifications and do not reach all vaccinated individuals, raising questions about risks of exacerbating health inequalities as well as security and privacy vulnerabilities.

316,28357,COVID-19 vaccines and evidence-based medicine,"OBJECTIVETo clarify efficacy, effectiveness, and harm of available vaccines for COVID-19, using measures in evidence-based medicine (EBM) that, in addition to relative risk reduction, consider absolute risk reduction and variations in baseline risks.

DESIGNSystematic review of studies that have considered impacts of vaccines in relation to baseline risks. Calculation of risk reduction and harms from published data in two random controlled trials and one population-based implementation study. Analysis of risk reductions in geographical areas with varying baseline risks. Comparison of results concerning COVID-19 vaccine and selected prior vaccines.

SETTINGRandom controlled trials of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in multiple countries; population-based study using Pfizer vaccine in Israel. Counties with varying baseline risks in the United States; states with varying baseline risks in India.

PARTICIPANTS43,448 and 30,420 subjects in the random controlled trials; 1,198,236 subjects in the population-based study.

INTERVENTIONSMulti-site random controlled trials of vaccine efficacy; population-based administration of vaccine with determination of effectiveness by comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESRelative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to be vaccinated to prevent one symptomatic infection (NNV), absolute risk of the intervention (ARI), and number needed to harm (NNH).

RESULTSA systematic review of literature in medicine and public health showed very few reports regarding ARR, NNV, ARI, and NNH; use of these indicators to compare benefits versus harms; or analysis of these EBM indicators in the context of varying baseline risks. From data in the two random controlled trials and one population-based study, calculated ARR was approximately 1 percent (as compared to RRR of 50 to 95 percent), and NNV was in the range of 100 to 500. In comparisons of ARR and NNV versus ARI and NNH, benefits and harms were not markedly different. From a sensitivity analysis of ARR and NNV in population groups with varying baseline risks, the effectiveness of vaccines as measured by ARR and NNV was substantially higher in regions with high as compared to low baseline risks. The ARR for COVID-19 vaccines was somewhat smaller and the NNV somewhat larger than achieved by some vaccines to prevent influenza and smallpox.

CONCLUSIONThe efficacy and effectiveness of major COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by RRR, are impressive. As measured by ARR and NNV, which take into account variation in baseline risks, the effectiveness of the vaccines is substantially higher in areas with higher baseline risks. This finding can contribute to educational efforts, informed consent procedures, and policy making about priorities for vaccine distribution, especially under conditions of access barriers linked to poverty and inequality.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICMajor COVID-19 vaccines so far have shown impressive efficacy in random controlled trials and effectiveness in population-based studies. To determine efficacy and effectiveness, these studies have used relative risk reduction (RRR), which shows the difference in event rate between those receiving and not receiving a vaccine. Reports of efficacy and effectiveness have not yet clarified other key indicators from evidence-based medicine (EBM) that consider variations baseline risks. Such indicators include measures of benefits such as absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to be vaccinated (NNV), as well as measures of harm such as absolute risk of the intervention (ARI) and number needed to harm (NNH).

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSFor COVID-19 vaccines, calculated ARR is somewhat lower and NNV somewhat higher than for certain prior vaccines such as those for influenza and smallpox. Indicators of harm for COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARI and NNH, appear to be in the same order of magnitude as indicators of benefit such as ARR and NNV. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARR and NNV, is substantially higher in geographical areas with high baseline risk, compared to areas with low baseline risk.

These findings can assist in informed consent procedures, educational efforts, and priority setting in policies about distribution of vaccines, especially in the context of access barriers related to poverty and inequality.",02/07/2021,10.1101/2021.06.28.21259039,Howard Waitzkin,"University of New Mexico, Allende Program in Social Medicine",medrxiv,0,0,,
318,28399,Transmissibility of COVID-19 among Vaccinated Individuals: A Rapid Literature Review,"ObjectivesThis is an update of a previous report that examined literature published up to March 11th, 2021. Sixteen additional studies have been included in this update. The objective of this report is to identify comparative observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing forward transmission from vaccinated people, and studies examining the biological plausibility of vaccination-induced transmission reduction.

MethodA search of databases, MEDLINE, Embase, L-OVE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted to identify RCTs or comparative observational studies evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in the prevention of transmission, asymptomatic infections and transmissibility of COVID-19 among vaccinated persons. An additional search of grey literature was conducted. This search is current to May 4th, 2021.

ResultsIn this update, 16 additional studies, including 9 human and 7 animal studies, were included. Therefore, this review examines a total of 33 included studies: 21 human studies and 12 preclinical animal studies. Evidence from two large household surveillance studies from the UK suggests that a single or full dose of AstraZeneca (AZ) and Pfizer-BioNtech (PfBnT) vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination by up to 54%. The AZ vaccine trials in the general population suggest that an initial low dose followed by a standard dose may provide up to 59% protection against asymptomatic or unknown infection, although efficacy against these outcomes was not demonstrated following two standard doses. PfBnT vaccine observational studies in the general population suggest up to 90% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection after seven or more days of full dose vaccination. Up to 75% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection was reported after full- dose in healthcare workers. Across RCTs examining asymptomatic infection in the general population, one dose of Moderna was shown to provide an efficacy of 61.4% against asymptomatic infection 21 days after the first dose; in another trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy of 74% 28 days after the first dose. Lastly, seven of eight studies found significantly increased cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load, in PfBnT or AZ vaccinated individuals compared with those who were unvaccinated.

ConclusionThe AZ and PfBnT vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination. More studies have found the vaccines to significantly reduce the risk of asymptomatic infection and significantly increase cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load. Further research is needed to evaluate post-vaccination infectivity and transmission of both the wild type COVID-19 virus and the variants of concern from other jurisdictions.",02/07/2021,10.1101/2021.06.29.21255526,Fiona Clement,"University of Calgary, Health Technology Assessment Unit",medrxiv,0,0,,

The efficacy results from a phase 2b/3 trial of a ninth vaccine candidate, CVnCoV (CUREVAC), was announced on 16 June 20212. The low efficacy of this new mRNA vaccine, which showed only 47% protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, was surprising given the high efficacy of two previous mRNA-based vaccines3,4. A number of factors have been suggested to play a role in the low efficacy in the CVnCoV study, particularly around the dose and immunogenicity of the vaccine (which uses an unmodified mRNA construct5,6) and the potential role of infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants (which were the dominant strains observed in the CVnCoV trial)2.",30/06/2021,10.1101/2021.06.29.21259504,David S Khoury,"Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia",medrxiv,0,0,,
340,29377,Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: a data-driven prioritization,"For the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible schemes to be simulated.

Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest, such as new infections, due to vaccination that fully immunizes a single individual. We express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands.

Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths.

The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. The principle of allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.

Author summaryVaccination is the key to controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the early stages of an epidemic, there is shortage of vaccine stocks. Here, we propose an algorithm that computes an optimal vaccine distribution among groups for each intervention objective (e.g., minimizing new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths). Unlike existing approaches that use detailed information on at-risk contacts between and among groups, the proposed algorithm requires only routine surveillance data on the number of cases. This method is applicable even when multiple vaccines are available. Simulation results show that the allocation scheme optimized by our algorithm performed the best compared with other strategies such as allocating vaccines at random and in the order of age. Our results also reveal that an allocation scheme optimized for one specific objective is not necessarily efficient for another, indicating the importance of the decision-making at the early phase of distributions.",22/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.20.21260889,Fuminari Miura,National Institute for Public Health and the Environment,medrxiv,0,1,,
342,29536,Prevention and Control of Acute Respiratory Viral Infections in Adult Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Ginseng-Based Clinical Trials.,"IntroductionAcute respiratory infections are continuously emerging. Discovered in Wuhan city, China in 2019, COV-SARS-2 and most viral respiratory diseases presently do not have a definitive cure. This paper aims to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of ginseng for prevention and control of acute respiratory illness including SARS-COV-2 in adult population.

MethodWe performed a systematic literature review using databases PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane library from 1st through the 27th of April 2020. All related articles that reported the use of Ginseng in COVID-19 patients were included in this analysis. Screening was done by 2-independent researchers. The meta-analysis was performed using comprehensive meta-analysis package.

Result596 articles were retrieved for the time frame. After screening, 5 articles with RCTs outcomes relevant to the review were selected. Ginseng was found to be effective in the reduction of risk by 38 % and 3-days shorter duration of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in all trials than placebo.

ConclusionAs the world continues to race to find a cure, it is important to consider the use of ginseng which has been proven over the years to be effective in the treatment of acute respiratory illnesses. Further studies should however be conducted to determine the right dosage to improve efficacy and prevent adverse events.

FundingThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

MethodsThis was a randomized, two-arm, controlled, multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 HIG in patients who were hospitalized with moderate-severe COVID-19 infection.

ResultsA total of 60 patients were randomized (30 in each arm). Overall, COVID-19 HIG was well-tolerated without any serious treatment-emergent adverse event or tolerability issue. The mean change in ordinal scale by day 8 was 1.7{+/-}1.61 in the test arm vs. 2.0{+/-}1.68 in the control arm (mITT; p=0.367). Early and high NAbs were observed in the test arm compared to the control arm.

More patients had negative RT-PCR by day 3 for the test arm vs. the control arm (mITT: 46.67% in test vs. 37.93% in control). The median time to be RT-PCR negative was 5.5 days for the test arm vs. 8.0 days for the control arm for PP population. Patients receiving COVID-19 HIG showed early improvement (reduction) in the biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, and D-dimer).

ConclusionCOVID-19 HIG was found to be safe and well-tolerated. Early and high NAbs were achieved in COVID-19 HIG recipients qualifying the product as a suitable treatment option, particularly in an immunocompromised state. It should be given early in infection to mitigate progression to severe disease. It should be evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis as well as for prevention (where a vaccine is not suitable or effective).

349,29767,Measuring vaccine efficacy against infection and disease in clinical trials: sources and magnitude of bias in COVID-19 vaccine efficacy estimates,"Background Phase III trials have estimated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. We explore the direction and magnitude of potential biases in these estimates and their implications for vaccine protection against infection and against disease in breakthrough infections. Methods We developed a mathematical model that accounts for natural and vaccine-induced immunity, changes in serostatus and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of tests for infection and antibodies. We estimated expected biases in VE against symptomatic, asymptomatic and any SARS-CoV-2 infections and against disease following infection for a range of vaccine characteristics and measurement approaches, and the likely overall biases for published trial results that included asymptomatic infections. Results VE against asymptomatic infection measured by PCR or serology is expected to be low or negative for vaccines that prevent disease but not infection. VE against any infection is overestimated when asymptomatic infections are less likely to be detected than symptomatic infections and the vaccine protects against symptom development. A competing bias towards underestimation arises for estimates based on tests with imperfect specificity, especially when testing is performed frequently. Our model indicates considerable uncertainty in Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S VE against any infection, with slightly higher than published, bias-adjusted values of 59.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38.4 to 77.1) and 70.9% (95% UI 49.8 to 80.7) respectively. Conclusion Multiple biases are likely to influence COVID-19 VE estimates, potentially explaining the observed difference between ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. These biases should be considered when interpreting both efficacy and effectiveness study results.",31/07/2021,10.1101/2021.07.30.21260912,Lucy R. Williams,Imperial College London,medrxiv,0,1,,
