169,21460,Age-related heterogeneity in Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following BNT162b2 vaccination,"BackgroundVaccines remain the cornerstone for containing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. mRNA vaccines provide protection in clinical trials using a two-dose approach, separated by a three to four week gap. UK policy in 2021 is to extend the dosing interval from three to twelve weeks. There is a paucity of data in the elderly, even though these individuals are the first to receive vaccines due to risk of severe disease. Here we assessed real world immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2.

MethodsWe did a prospective cohort study of individuals presenting for first dose vaccination. Following the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, we measured IFN{gamma} T cell responses, as well as binding antibody (IgA, IgG and IgG1-4) responses to Spike and Spike RBD. We also measured neutralising antibody responses to Spike in sera using a lentiviral pseudotyping system. We correlated age with immune responses and compared responses after the first and second doses.

FindingsMedian age was 63.5 years amongst 42 participants. Three weeks after the first dose a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved adequate neutralisation titre of >1:20 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 (8/17 versus 19/24, p=0.03). Geometric mean neutralisation titres in this age group after the first dose were lower than in younger individuals (p<0.001). Binding IgA and IgG1 and 3 responses developed post vaccination, as observed in natural infection. T-cell responses were not different in those above or below 80 years. Following the second dose, 50% neutralising antibody titres were above 1:20 in all individuals and there was no longer a difference by age grouping.

InterpretationA high proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have suboptimal neutralising antibody responses following first dose vaccination with BNT162b2, cautioning against extending the dosing interval in this high risk population.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles published from June 1st 2020 until February 8th 2021. We limited our search to English language papers. We used the following terms: ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""vaccine"" OR ""BNT162b2"" OR ""Pfizer/BioNTech"". We identified only one paper. It showed lower neutralising antibody responses following the first dose of BNT162b in a small group of 12 individuals over 65 compared to those under 65. There were no data for patients above 82 years of age and no data on T cell responses by age. We did not find pre-prints on age related heterogeneity in individuals immunised with the Pfizer/BioNtech mRNA vaccine.

What this study addsWe show real world immune responses in forty two individuals to BNT162b2, spanning both T and B cell arms. We show that a high proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have suboptimal neutralising antibody responses following first dose vaccination with BNT162b2. The second dose generates robust responses in these poor responders. We quantify SARS-CoV-2 Spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) IgA and IgG isotypes as well as IgG subclasses. Finally we show that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are robustly induced by first dose vaccination and are not impacted by age.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese data caution against extending the dosing interval of BNT162b2 in the elderly population, particularly during periods of high transmission, and also where there is risk of infection with variants that are less susceptible to vaccine-elicited neutralising antibodies.",20/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.03.21251054,Ravindra K Gupta,University of Cambridge,medrxiv,Real-world immunogenicity,0
52,10732,Phase 1/2 Study to Describe the Safety and Immunogenicity of a COVID-19 RNA Vaccine Candidate (BNT162b1) in Adults 18 to 55 Years of Age: Interim Report,"In March 2020, the WHO declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1 With >8.8 million cases and >450,000 deaths reported globally, a vaccine is urgently needed. We report the available safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose escalation study among healthy adults, 18-55 years of age, randomized to receive 2 doses, separated by 21 days, of 10 g, 30 g, or 100 g of BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified, mRNA vaccine that encodes trimerized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein RBD. Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 1.8-to 2.8-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate.",01/07/2020,10.1101/2020.06.30.20142570,Judith Absalon,"Pfizer, Inc., Pearl River, NY",medrxiv,pubmed,0
59,11877,Concurrent human antibody andTH1 type T-cell responses elicited by a COVID-19 RNA vaccine,"An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 COVID-19 vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after BNT162b1 vaccination from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1 to 50 {micro}g of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those in a COVID-19 convalescent human serum panel (HCS). Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.7-fold (1 {micro}g) to 3.5-fold (50 {micro}g) those of HCS. Immune sera broadly neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had TH1 skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon (IFN){gamma} was produced by a high fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest multiple beneficial mechanisms with potential to protect against COVID-19.",20/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.17.20140533,Ugur Sahin,BioNTech,medrxiv,pubmed,0
65,13038,"Immunogenicity and Safety of a SARS-CoV-2 Inactivated Vaccine in Healthy Adults Aged 18-59 years: Report of the Randomized, Double-blind, and Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Clinical Trial","BACKGROUNDThe top priority for the control of COVID-19 pandemic currently is the development of a vaccine. A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac).

METHODSWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 g/0.5 mL or 6 g /0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were taken for antibody assay.

RESULTSCoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed. Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good immunogenicity with the lower 3 g dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day 0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among different dosage and vaccination schedules.

CONCLUSIONSFavorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated on both schedules and both dosages, which support the conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule/dosage per different scenarios.",10/08/2020,10.1101/2020.07.31.20161216,Feng-Cai Zhu,Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention,medrxiv,pubmed,0
68,12926,First-in-Human Trial of a SARS CoV 2 Recombinant Spike Protein Nanoparticle Vaccine,"BackgroundNVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. We present the Day 35 primary analysis of our trial of NVX-CoV2373 with or without the saponin-based Matrix-M1 adjuvant in healthy adults.

MethodsThis is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial in 131 healthy adults. Trial vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart. Primary outcomes were reactogenicity, safety labs, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, wild-type virus neutralizing antibody, and T-cell responses.

ResultsParticipants received NVX-CoV2373 with or without Matrix-M1 (n=106) or placebo (n=25). There were no serious adverse events. Reactogenicity was mainly mild in severity and of short duration (mean [&le;]2 days), with second vaccinations inducing greater local and systemic reactogenicity. The adjuvant significantly enhanced immune responses and was antigen dose-sparing, and the two-dose 5g NVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 vaccine induced mean anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody responses that exceeded the mean responses in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients with clinically significant illnesses. The vaccine also induced antigen-specific T cells with a largely T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 was well tolerated and elicited robust immune responses (IgG and neutralization) four-fold higher than the mean observed in COVID-19 convalescent serum from participants with clinical symptoms requiring medical care and induced CD4+ T-cell responses biased toward a Th1 phenotype. These findings suggest that the vaccine may confer protection and support transition to efficacy evaluations to test this hypothesis.

72,13567,RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine BNT162b2 Selected for a Pivotal Efficacy Study,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have spread to millions of people globally. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available.

MethodsHealthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

ResultsIn both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose- dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults.

ConclusionThese results support selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate for Phase 2/3 large-scale safety and efficacy evaluation, currently underway.",28/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.17.20176651,Judith Absalon,"Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer, Inc.",medrxiv,pubmed,0
86,15524,"Safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine candidate: interim results of a phase 1/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

120,18968,"A first-in-human evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of SCB-2019, an adjuvanted, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein subunit vaccine for COVID-19 in healthy adults; a phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BackgroundAs part of the accelerated development of prophylactic vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) we report a first-in-human dose-finding and adjuvant justification study of SCB-2019, a novel protein subunit vaccine candidate composed of a stabilised trimeric form of the spike (S)-protein produced in CHO-cells, combined with two different adjuvants.

MethodsThis phase 1 study was done in one centre in Western Australia in 151 healthy adult volunteers in two age groups (18-54 and 55-75 years), allocated to 15 groups (nine young and six older adults) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, or 3 g, 9 g or 30 g SCB-2019, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding and ACE2-competitive binding IgG antibodies by ELISA, and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay; cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining.

FindingsWe report on 148 participants with at least 4 weeks follow-up post dose 2. Three participants withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated SAE (pituitary adenoma). Vaccination was well tolerated, with few Grade 3 solicited adverse events (AE). Most local AEs were mild injection site pain, which were more frequent with formulations containing AS03 than CpG/Alum or unadjuvanted SCB-2019. Systemic AEs, mostly transient headache, fatigue or myalgia, were more frequent in young adults than older adults after the first dose, but similar after second doses. Unadjuvanted SCB-2019 elicited minimal immune responses, but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of AS03 or CpG/Alum induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both young and older adults. Titres were higher than those observed in a panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera in all AS03 groups and high dose CpG/Alum groups. Both adjuvanted formulations elicited Th1-biased CD4+ T cell responses.

InterpretationSCB-2019 trimeric protein formulated with AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.

130,19395,"Safety and immunogenicity trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-BBV152: a phase 1, double-blind, randomised control trial","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a TLR 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG).

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind randomized controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152. A total of 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each) prepared with 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel, and an Algel only control arm (n=75). Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on day 0 (baseline) and day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity based on the anti-IgG S1 response (detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and wild-type virus neutralization [microneutralization and plaque reduction neutralization assays]). Cell-mediated responses were also evaluated.

ResultsReactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events. The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved. One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-g and 6-g Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype.

ConclusionsBBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2{degrees}C and 8{degrees}C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for the phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are underway.

178,22168,Real-time analysis of a mass vaccination effort confirms the safety of FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNtech,"As the COVID-19 vaccination campaign unfolds as one of the most rapid and widespread in history,it is important to continuously assess the real world safety of the FDA-authorized vaccines. Curation from large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) allows for near real-time safety evaluations that were not previously possible. Here, we advance context- and sentiment-aware deep neural networks over the multi-state Mayo Clinic enterprise (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin) for automatically curating the adverse effects mentioned by physicians in over 108,000 EHR clinical notes between December 1st 2020 to February 8th 2021. We retrospectively compared the clinical notes of 31,069 individuals who received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine to those of 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who were propensity matched by demographics, residential location, and history of prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. We find that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were seen in the the clinic at similar rates within 21 days of the first or second actual or assigned vaccination dose (first dose Odds Ratio = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09-1.16; second dose Odds Ratio = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Further, the incidence rates of all surveyed adverse effects were similar or lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals after either vaccine dose. Finally, the most frequently documented adverse effects within 7 days of each vaccine dose were fatigue (Dose 1: 1.77%, Dose 2: 1.2%),nausea (Dose 1: 1.05%, Dose 2: 0.84%), myalgia (Dose 1: 0.67%; Dose 2: 0.66%), diarrhea (Dose 1: 0.67%; Dose 2: 0.46%), arthralgia (Dose 1: 0.64%; Dose 2: 0.57%), erythema (Dose 1: 0.59%; Dose 2: 0.46%), vomiting (Dose 1: 0.45%, Dose 2: 0.29%) and fever (Dose 1: 0.29%; Dose 2: 0.23%). These remarkably low frequencies of adverse effects recorded in EHRs versus those derived from active solicitation during clinical trials (arthralgia: 24-46%; erythema: 9.5-14.7%; myalgia: 38-62%; fever: 14.2-15.5%) emphasize the rarity of vaccine-associated adverse effects requiring clinical attention.

165,21149,The effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162 b 2 vaccine in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization: real-world evidence,"BackgroundBNT162b2 vaccines showed high efficacy against COVID-19 in a randomised controlled phase-III trial. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in real life settings is urgently needed, especially given the global disease surge. Hence, we assessed the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the BNT162b2 Phase-III results, we hypothesized that the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinees will decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence during the preceding days.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2{middle dot}6 million-member state-mandated health provider in Israel. Study population consisted of all members aged 16 or above years who were vaccinated with BNT162b2-vaccine between December/19/2020 and January/15/2021. We collected information regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test from days after first dose to January/17/2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13-24 were compared to days 1-12 after first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models.

FindingsData of 503,875 individuals (mean age 59{middle dot}7 years SD=14{middle dot}7, 47{middle dot}8% males) were analysed, of whom 351,897 had 13-24 days of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0{middle dot}57% (n=2484) during days 1-12 and 0{middle dot}27% (n=614) in days 13-24. A 51{middle dot}4% relative risk reduction (RRR) was calculated in weighted-average daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 43{middle dot}41-per-100,000(SE=12{middle dot}07) in days 1-12 to 21{middle dot}08-per-100,000(SE=6{middle dot}16) in days 13-24 following immunization. The decrement in incidence was evident from day 18 after first dose. Similar RRRs were calculated in individuals aged 60 or above (44.5%), younger individuals (50.2%), females (50.0%) and males (52.1%). Findings were similar in sub-populations and patients with various comorbidities.

ConclusionsWe demonstrated an effectiveness of 51% of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization with the first dose. Immunization with the second dose should be continued to attain the anticipated protection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for follow-up studies regarding the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine without any language restrictions. The search terms were (BNT162b2 OR mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine) AND (effectiveness OR real-world OR phase IV) until Jan 15, 2021. We found no relevant observational studies among humans. We also assessed Phase II and Phase III clinical trials with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first and largest phase IV study on the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in real-world settings. Our findings showed that the first dose of the vaccine is associated with an approximately 51% reduction in the incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections at 13 to 24 days after immunization compared to the rate during the first 12 days. Similar levels of effectiveness were found across age groups, sex, as well as among individuals residing in Arab or ultra-orthodox Jewish communities that display an increased COVID-19 risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe study results indicate that in real life the first dose of the new BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine confers around 50% protection against overall SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Together our findings and the 95% efficacy shown in the phase III trial, suggest that the BNT162b2 vaccine should be administered in two doses to achieve maximum protection and impact in terms of disease burden reduction and possibly reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. COVID-19 vaccines should be urgently deployed globally.",29/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250612,Gabriel Chodcik,Maccabitech,medrxiv,Effectiveness,0

89,16079,An in-depth investigation of the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,"BACKGROUNDIn-depth investigations of the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed.

METHODIn a phase I randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial involving 192 healthy adults 18-59 years of age, two injections of three different doses (50 EU, 100 EU and 150 EU) of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or the placebo were administered intramuscularly with a 2- or 4-week interval between the injections. The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated within 28 days.

FINDINGIn this study, 191 subjects assigned to three doses groups or the placebo group completed the 28-day trial. There were 44 adverse reactions within the 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue, and no abnormal variations were observed in 48 cytokines in the serum samples of immunized subjects. The serum samples diluted from 1:32 to 1:4096 and incubated with the virus did not show antibody-dependent enhancement effects (ADEs) with regard to human natural killer cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. At day 14, the seroconversion rates had reached 92%, 100% and 96% with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.0, 54.5 and 37.1, and at day 28, the seroconversion rates had reached 80%, 96% and 92% with GMTs of 10.6, 15.4 and 19.6in 0, 14 and 0, 28 procedures, respectively. Seroconversion was associated with the synchronous upregulation of ELISA antibodies against the S protein, N protein and virion and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Transcriptome analysis shaped the genetic diversity of immune response induced by the vaccine.

INTERPRETATIONIn a population aged 18-59 years, this inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was safe and immunogenic.

104,17617,Phase 1 trial of a Candidate Recombinant Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 Disease Produced in Plants,"Longer AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004)

MethodsThe study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 {micro}g, 7.5 {micro}g, and 15 {micro}g) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42.

ResultsA total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN{gamma} and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups.

ConclusionThese data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 g CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were [~]10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 g)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations

Shorter AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSVirus-like particles (VLP) displaying recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers were produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. This candidate vaccine (CoVLP) was evaluated in healthy adults 18-55 years of age alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 (NCT04450004).

MethodsThis randomized, partially-blinded, two-dose, dose-escalation study assessed CoVLP (3.75, 7.5 or 15 {micro}g/dose) administered intramuscularly alone or with CpG1018 or AS03 in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults (18-55 years). Primary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity are reported to day 42. Neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) were assessed using a VSV pseudovirus assay and cellular responses by ELISpot (IFN{gamma}, IL-4).

Results180 subjects (avg.34.3yrs) were recruited. All formulations were well-tolerated but adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Adverse events were highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups and increased in frequency/severity after dose two. CoVLP alone elicited weak humoral responses but modest cellular responses were detectable after dose two. Both adjuvants increased immunogenicity significantly, particularly after dose two. A significant NtAb response after dose one was only seen in CoVLP+AS03 groups. The vaccine dose had little impact on levels of NtAb responses achieved in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Both adjuvants also increased IFN{gamma} and IL-4 responses but these cellular responses also tended to be highest in the AS03-adjuvanted groups.

ConclusionCoVLP {+/-} adjuvants was well-tolerated. Several adjuvanted formulations elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after dose 2. Even at the lowest CoVLP+AS03 dose, NtAb titers were [~]10-times higher than in convalescent serum with a balanced IFN{gamma} and IL-4 response. These findings support the transition of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03) to further clinical evaluation.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized as the causative agent of COVID-19 in early 2020. Since that time, >150 candidate vaccines are reported to be under development of which 47 have entered clinical trials (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines accessed Nov 4, 2020). No vaccine to prevent COVID-19 has been licensed yet for either emergency or general use in North America or Europe. We searched PubMed for research articles published between July 2019 and November 4, 2020, using the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""vaccine"", ""clinical trial"" OR ""human"", AND ""phase"". The same terms were used to search ClinTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. We identified 10 peer-reviewed studies, describing phase 1 or 1/2 trials using a range of novel (eg: RNA, DNA, non-replicating virus vectored) and more traditional vaccine approaches (eg: inactivated virus or recombinant protein {+/-} adjuvants). None of these candidate vaccines was produced in plants. These reports demonstrate that several different vaccination strategies (typically delivered in two doses 14-28 days apart) are capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody responses. In several cases, vaccine-induced cellular responses against SARS-COV-2 antigens - predominantly the spike (S) protein - can also be demonstrated. Although local and systemic adverse events following vaccination have varied between reports, the trials published to date suggest that each of these candidate vaccines is well-tolerated in the context of an evolving pandemic.

Added value of this studyWe report the results of the first clinical study of CoVLP, a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that is produced by transient transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These VLPs spontaneously assemble at the plant cell membrane and display SARS-COV-2 trimers of stabilized pre-fusion S protein on their surface. The vaccine was administered as two intramuscular doses 21 days apart at three dose levels (S protein content 3.75, 7,5 or 15g) alone or adjuvanted with either CpG1018 or AS03. All formulations were well-tolerated although both adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Humoral (anti-S IgG and neutralizing antibodies) as well as cellular responses (IFNg and IL4 ELISpots) were detectable in almost all subjects who received adjuvanted formulations 21 days after the second dose at all COVLP dose levels. Both antibody and cellular responses were highest in subjects who received AS03-adjuvanted formulations. Even at the lowest dose level (3.75g), the neutralizing antibody titers 21 days after the second dose in subjects who received the AS03-afdjuvanted vaccine were 10-50-fold higher than those seen in subjects recovering from COVID-19 infection.

Implications of all the available evidenceEffective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to reduce the burden of disease and contribute to ending the global pandemic. Although no immune correlates for SARS-CoV-2 have been defined, it is likely that both arms of the immune system contribute to protection. After two doses of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03), strong humoral and cellular responses were induced supporting the further clinical development of this vaccine.",06/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.04.20226282,Nathalie Landry,Medicago inc.,medrxiv,1,0
106,17705,Phase 1 Assessment of the Safety and Immunogenicity of an mRNA- Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Candidate Against SARS-CoV-2 in Human Volunteers,"There is an urgent need for vaccines to counter the COVID-19 pandemic due to infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Evidence from convalescent sera and preclinical studies has identified the viral Spike (S) protein as a key antigenic target for protective immune responses. We have applied an mRNA-based technology platform, RNActive(R), to develop CVnCoV which contains sequence optimized mRNA coding for a stabilized form of S protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Following demonstration of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in animal models we performed a dose-escalation phase 1 study in healthy 18-60 year-old volunteers.

This interim analysis shows that two doses of CVnCoV ranging from 2 g to 12 g per dose, administered 28 days apart were safe. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. There were dose-dependent increases in frequency and severity of solicited systemic adverse events, and to a lesser extent of local reactions, but the majority were mild or moderate and transient in duration. Immune responses when measured as IgG antibodies against S protein or its receptor-binding domain (RBD) by ELISA, and SARS-CoV-2-virus neutralizing antibodies measured by micro-neutralization, displayed dose-dependent increases. Median titers measured in these assays two weeks after the second 12 g dose were comparable to the median titers observed in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Seroconversion (defined as a 4-fold increase over baseline titer) of virus neutralizing antibodies two weeks after the second vaccination occurred in all participants who received 12 g doses.

Preliminary results in the subset of subjects who were enrolled with known SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at baseline show that CVnCoV is also safe and well tolerated in this population, and is able to boost the pre-existing immune response even at low dose levels.

Based on these results, the 12 g dose is selected for further clinical investigation, including a phase 2b/3 study that will investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine CVnCoV.",09/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.09.20228551,Lidia Oostvogels,CureVac,medrxiv,1,0
128,19198,BNT162b2 induces SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies and T cells in humans,"BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S) stabilized in the prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, we reported preliminary BNT162b2 safety and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 vaccine trial1. We present here antibody and T cell responses from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 19-55 years of age, after BNT162b2 prime/boost vaccination at 1 to 30 {micro}g dose levels. BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with S-binding IgG concentrations above those in a COVID-19 human convalescent sample (HCS) panel. Day 29 (7 days post-boost) SARS-CoV-2 serum 50% neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.3-fold (1 {micro}g) to 3.3-fold (30 {micro}g) those of the HCS panel. The BNT162b2-elicited sera neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Concurrently, in most participants, S-specific CD8+ and T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells had expanded, with a high fraction producing interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma}). Using peptide MHC multimers, the epitopes recognised by several BNT162b2-induced CD8+ T cells when presented on frequent MHC alleles were identified. CD8+ T cells were shown to be of the early-differentiated effector-memory phenotype, with single specificities reaching 0.01-3% of circulating CD8+ T cells. In summary, vaccination with BNT162b2 at well tolerated doses elicits a combined adaptive humoral and cellular immune response, which together may contribute to protection against COVID-19.",11/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.09.20245175,Ugur Sahin,BioNTech,medrxiv,1,0
137,19748,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein vaccine against COVID-19 in adults: pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials","BackgroundA safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.

MethodsWe did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085.

FindingsBetween June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 g or 50 g dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 g group) and 93% (the 50 g group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 g group and 117.8 for the 50 g group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 g group and 69.1 for the 50 g group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses. The 50 g group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 g group.

InterpretationThe protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 g vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

138,19753,"Safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 (a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial) and the persistence of immune responses from a phase 1 follow-up report","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 {micro}g or 6 {micro}g) formulated with a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG). Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152: 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG.

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion ([&ge;]4-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT50). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose).

FindingsAmong 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92{middle dot}9% (88{middle dot}2, 96{middle dot}2) and 98{middle dot}3% (95{middle dot}1, 99{middle dot}6) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6{middle dot}9, 13{middle dot}2) and 10.3% (7{middle dot}4, 13{middle dot}8) in the 3 {micro}g and 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73{middle dot}5% (63{middle dot}6, 81{middle dot}9), 81{middle dot}1% (71{middle dot}4, 88{middle dot}1), and 73{middle dot}1% (62{middle dot}9, 81{middle dot}8) of individuals in the 3 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, 6 {micro}g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 {micro}g with Algel groups, respectively.

InterpretationIn the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The safety profile of BBV152 is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates. The 6 {micro}g Algel-IMDG formulation was selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial.

CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion S protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression system. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations.

MethodsThis Phase I/II, randomised, double-blind study (NCT04537208) is being conducted in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18-49 and [&ge;]50 years) and randomised to receive one (on Day[D]1) or two doses (D1, D22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing: low-dose (LD, effective dose 1.3 {micro}g) or high-dose (HD, 2.6 {micro}g) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline); or unadjuvanted HD (18-49 years only). Safety was assessed up to D43. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising and binding antibody profiles were assessed in D1, D22 and D36 serum samples.

FindingsThe interim safety analyses included 439/441 randomised participants. There were no related unsolicited immediate AEs, serious AEs, medically attended AEs classified as severe, or AE of special interest. More grade 3 solicited reactions were reported than expected after the second dose in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising and binding antibody responses after two vaccine doses were higher in adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted groups, in AS03-versus AF03-adjuvanted groups, in HD versus LD groups, and in younger versus older age strata.

InterpretationThe lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age stratum, and the higher than anticipated reactogenicity post dose 2 were likely due to a higher than anticipated host cell protein content and lower than planned antigen dose in the clinical material. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.",20/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.19.20248611,Guy Debruyn,"Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA, USA",medrxiv,1,0

177,22117,"Phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination: rapid assessment of policy adoption, reach and effectiveness to protect the most vulnerable in the US","ObjectivesThe US and rest of the world have suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year. The high transmissibility and severity of this virus have provoked governments to adopt a variety of mitigation strategies. Some of these previous measures, such as social distancing and mask mandates, were effective in reducing the case growth rate yet became economically and administratively difficult to enforce as the pandemic continued. In late December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines were first approved in the US and states began a phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is limited quantitative evidence regarding the effectiveness of the phased COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to provide a rapid assessment of the adoption, reach, and effectiveness of the phased implementation of COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsWe utilize an event-study analysis to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the state-level, daily COVID-19 case growth rate.

ResultsThrough this analysis, we assert that vaccination is effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 shortly after the first shots were given. Specifically, the case growth rate declined by 0.124, 0.347, 0.345, 0.464, 0.490, and 0.756 percentage points corresponding to the 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, and 26 or more day periods after the initial shots.

ConclusionsThe findings could be insightful for policymakers as they work to optimize vaccine distribution in later phases, and also for the public as the COVID-19 related health risk is a contentious issue.",23/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.19.21252118,Chaowei Yang,George Mason University,medrxiv,0,1
180,22127,COVID-19 Spreading dynamics in an age-structured population with selective relaxation of restrictions for vaccinated individuals : a mathematical modeling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccination of healthcare and other essential workers is underway in many countries while immunization of the general public is expected to begin in the next several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately permitted to return to normal activities.

MethodsWe use a delay differential equation model to calculate the effects of vaccinee ""immunity passports"" on the epidemic spreading trajectories. The model incorporates age-structuring to account for children who are ineligible for vaccination, and senior citizens who are especially vulnerable to the disease. We consider consensus strains of virus as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 and B1.351 in our analysis.

ResultsWe find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, unrestricted vaccinee--vaccinee interactions do not derail the epidemic from a path towards elimination. Vaccinee--non-vaccinee interactions should however be treated with far more caution. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be the better part of a year before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or ceased. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent, restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until the elimination of the disease is achieved. In all cases, the death tolls can be reduced by vaccinating the vulnerable population first.

ConclusionsDesigning high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drives with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants of efficacy, if any, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive augmented with selective relaxations for vaccinees will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death tolls and socio-economic cost.",23/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.22.21252241,B Shayak,Cornell University,medrxiv,0,1

181,22233,"A Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern, B.1.526, Identified in New York","Recent months have seen surges of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the globe along with considerable viral evolution. Extensive mutations in the spike protein of variants B.1.1.7, B1.351, and P.1 have raised concerns that the efficacy of current vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies could be threatened. In vitro studies have shown that one mutation, E484K, plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of some monoclonal antibodies as well as most convalescent and vaccinee sera against variant B.1.351. In fact, two vaccine trials have recently reported lower protective efficacy in South Africa, where B.1.351 is dominant. To survey for these novel variants in our patient population in New York City, PCR assays were designed to identify viruses with two signature mutations, E484K and N501Y. We observed a steady increase in the detection rate from late December to mid-February, with an alarming rise to 12.3% in the past two weeks. Whole genome sequencing further demonstrated that most of our E484K isolates (n=49/65) fell within a single lineage: NextStrain clade 20C or Pangolin lineage B.1.526. Patients with this novel variant came from diverse neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, and they were on average older and more frequently hospitalized. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences in the database further reveal that this B.1.526 variant is scattered in the Northeast of US, and its unique set of spike mutations may also pose an antigenic challenge for current interventions.",25/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.23.21252259,Anne-Catrin Uhlemann,"Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Medicine - Infectious Diseases",medrxiv,0,1

179,22254,Early Antibody Responses Associated with Survival in COVID19 Patients,"Neutralizing antibodies to the SARS CoV-2 spike proteins have been issued Emergency Use Authorizations and are a likely mechanism of vaccines to prevent COVID-19. However, benefit of treatment with monoclonal antibodies has only been observed in clinical trials in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 but not in patients who are hospitalized and/or have advanced disease. To address this observation, we evaluated the timing of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody production in hospitalized patients with the use of a highly sensitive multiplexed bead-based immunoassay allowing for early detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We found that significantly lower levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the first week after symptom onset were associated with patients who expired as compared to patients who were discharged. We also developed a model, based on antibody level trajectory, to predict COVID 19 outcome that is compatible with greater antibody benefit earlier in COVID 19 disease.

Author SummaryWe evaluated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 over time in patients that were hospitalized with COVID 19. Early detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was associated with survival in patients hospitalized with COVID 19. Early antibody levels predicted outcome in our study. This result is consistent with the benefit of therapeutic antibodies early in the course of COVID 19 disease. With additional study, early antibody levels may be helpful in deciding on appropriate therapies.",26/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.21.21252168,Steven Kozlowski,US Food and Drug Administration,medrxiv,0,1

In the initial phase of population-based vaccination in the United States (U.S.) and United Kingdom (U.K.), vaccine hesitancy and limited access may result in disparities in uptake. Methods: We performed a cohort study among U.S. and U.K. participants in the smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study (March 24, 2020-February 16, 2021). We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (unsure/not willing) and receipt. Results: In the U.S. (n=87,388), compared to White non-Hispanic participants, the multivariable ORs of vaccine hesitancy were 3.15 (95% CI: 2.86 to 3.47) for Black participants, 1.42 (1.28 to 1.58) for Hispanic participants, 1.34 (1.18 to 1.52) for Asian participants, and 2.02 (1.70 to 2.39) for participants reporting more than one race/other. In the U.K. (n=1,254,294), racial and ethnic minorities had similarly elevated hesitancy: compared to White participants, their corresponding ORs were 2.84 (95% CI: 2.69 to 2.99) for Black participants, 1.66 (1.57 to 1.76) for South Asian participants, 1.84 (1.70 to 1.98) for Middle East/East Asian participants, and 1.48 (1.39 to 1.57) for participants reporting more than one race/other. Among U.S. participants, the OR of vaccine receipt was 0.71 (0.64 to 0.79) for Black participants, a disparity that persisted among individuals who specifically endorsed a willingness to obtain a vaccine. In contrast, disparities in uptake were not observed in the U.K. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was greater among racial and ethnic minorities, and Black participants living in the U.S. were less likely to receive a vaccine than White participants. Lower uptake among Black participants in the U.S. during the initial vaccine rollout is attributable to both hesitancy and disparities in access.",28/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.25.21252402,Andrew T.

183,22308,Interpreting vaccine efficacy trial results for infection and transmission,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high efficacy of multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), but evidence remains scarce about vaccines' efficacy against infection with, and ability to transmit, the virus. We describe an approach to estimate these vaccines' effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which under reasonable assumptions forms a lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the primary outcome) and cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of carriage for vaccine vs. placebo provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against viral positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations that likely departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this estimate. Applying this approach to published data from the RCT of the Moderna vaccine, we estimate that one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more. We describe how these approaches can be translated into observational studies of vaccine effectiveness.",28/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.25.21252415,Rebecca Kahn,Harvard T.H.

2,3023,Global profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses of convalescents using a proteome microarray,"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and has become a global pandemic. There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific IgG and IgM responses. However, the IgG/ IgM responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.

Chest computed tomography (CT) has been found to support both, current diagnostic and disease monitoring. A joint approach to collect, analyze and share clinical and imaging information about COVID-19 in the highest quality possible is urgently needed.

MethodsAn evidence-based reporting template was developed for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia using an FDA-approved medical software. The annotation of qualitative and quantitative findings including radiomics features is performed directly on primary imaging data. For data collection, secondary information from the patient history and clinical data such as symptoms and comorbidities are queried.

ResultsLicense-royalty free, cloud-based web platform and on-premise deployments are offered. Hospitals can upload, assess, report and if pseudonymized share their COVID-19 cases. The aggregation of radiomics in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically documented in a single database, will lead to optimized diagnosis, risk stratification and response evaluation. A customizable analytics dashboard allows the explorative real-time data analysis of imaging features and clinical information.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19-Template is based on a systematic, computer-assisted and context-guided approach to collect, analyze and share data.

4,3771,Repurposing Therapeutics for COVID-19: Rapid Prediction of Commercially available drugs through Machine Learning and Docking,"BackgroundThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods and findingsWe perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID - DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions.

ConclusionsOur study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.

5,4144,Nitric oxide gas inhalation to prevent COVID-2019 in healthcare providers,"IntroductionIn human hosts, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome (named COVID-19) which can range from a mild involvement of the upper airways to a severe pneumonia with acute respiratory syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated transmission is an important route of spreading for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and healthcare providers are at the highest risk. As of February 2020, 1716, Chinese healthcare workers had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and at least 6 died. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or pharmacological prophylaxis to decrease the risk of healthcare providers contracting the infection.

Methods and analysisWe will randomize 470 healthcare providers scheduled to work with COVID 19 patients to receive nitric oxide gas administration (NO group, n=235) or no gas administration (control group, n=235). The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of subjects with COVID-19 disease at 14 days from enrollment. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of healthcare providers who present a positive real time RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV- 2 14 days after enrollment, the proportion of healthcare providers requiring quarantine, and the total number of quarantine days in the two groups.

Ethics and disseminationThe trial protocol is under the approval of The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) and recruitment is expected to start in April 2020.

6,4136,Association Between BCG Policy is Significantly Confounded by Age and is Unlikely to Alter Infection or Mortality Rates,"Recently a number of publications looked at the association between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on one hand and countries policies with respect to BCG vaccination on the other. This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the ""known immunological benefits"" of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation.

One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection).

Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context.

This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.",11/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055616,Stefan Kirov,Bristol Myers Squibb,medrxiv,0,0

Two recent studies have suggested a link between the BCG vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. In the present study we compared the impact of COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high disease burden and those with BCG revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe COVID-19. We found a significant difference in the CFR between the two groups of countries. Our data further supports the view that universal BCG vaccination has a protective effect on the course of COVID-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death. Clinical trials of BCG vaccine are urgently needed to establish its beneficial role in COVID-19 as suggested by the epidemiological data, especially in countries without a universal BCG vaccination policy.",19/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.07.20053272,Devi Dayal,"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India",medrxiv,0,0
8,4156,Efficacy of remdesivir versus placebo for the treatment of COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BackgroundIn spite of the global containment on prevention efforts, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuing to rise, with 1.1 million confirmed cases and 60,124 deaths recorded worldwide since 04 April 2020. The outbreak has a significant threat to international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19.

Method and analysisWe will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo.

9,4163,Estimating Probabilities of Success of Clinical Trials for Vaccines and Other Anti-Infective Therapeutics,"A key driver in biopharmaceutical investment decisions is the probability of success of a drug development program. We estimate the probabilities of success (PoS) of clinical trials for vaccines and other anti-infective therapeutics using 43,414 unique triplets of clinical trial, drug, and disease between January 1, 2000, and January 7, 2020, yielding 2,544 vaccine programs and 6,829 non-vaccine programs targeting infectious diseases. The overall estimated PoS for an industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6%, and 16.3% for an industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against monkeypox (100%), rotavirus (78.7%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6%). The three infectious diseases with the highest PoS for industry-sponsored non-vaccine therapeutics are smallpox (100%), CMV (31.8%), and onychomycosis (29.8%). Non-industry-sponsored vaccine and non-vaccine development programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8% and 8.2%, respectively. Viruses involved in recent outbreaks--MERS, SARS, Ebola, Zika--have had a combined total of only 45 non-vaccine development programs initiated over the past two decades, and no approved therapy to date (Note: our data was obtained just before the COVID-19 outbreak and do not contain information about the programs targeting this disease.) These estimates offer guidance both to biopharma investors as well as to policymakers seeking to identify areas most likely to be undeserved by private-sector engagement and in need of public-sector support.",14/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059600,Andrew W Lo,MIT,medrxiv,0,0

We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model--which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives--to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0 = 2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.",14/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059634,Andrew W Lo,MIT,medrxiv,0,0
11,4288,Molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs and traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19: A systematic scoping review,"BackgroundThe emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic has resulted in the need for urgent development of vaccines and drugs and the conduction of clinical trials to fight the outbreak. Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19.

ObjectiveThe objective of this systematic scoping review is to provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease.

Data SourcesThe research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 4 traditional Chinese medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) were extracted.

ConclusionsAll of the repurposed drugs that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides an insight to experimental validation of drugs and alternative medicine used for the treatment and control of COVID-19.",04/05/2020,10.1101/2020.04.10.20060376,Fui Fui Lem,Ministry of Health Malaysia,medrxiv,0,0

DesignMulticenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Setting16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020.

Participants150 patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone.

InterventionsHCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively).

Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone.

ResultsAmong 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days ({+/-} standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 ({+/-}10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non-recipients (N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events.

ConclusionsThe administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non-recipients.

What is already known on this topic-- The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposes substantial burdens on individuals, communities, health-care facilities, markets, governments, etc. globally.
-- There is no specific treatment approved for COVID-19 or vaccine to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus.
-- During the urgent pandemic, media headlines the utility of drugs without solid evidence but buries the side-effects of these drugs.


What this study adds-- In this randomized clinical trial of patients mainly with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19, exposure to hydroxychloroquine led to a similar probability of virus elimination comparing to the current standard-of-care.
-- Adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal related, were significantly increased in patients who received hydroxychloroquine.
-- Overall, the results from our trial do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19.

What this study addsOur trial does not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19 due to limited effects on virus eliminating and significantly increased adverse events.

13,4374,Identifying common pharmacotherapies associated with reduced COVID-19 morbidity using electronic health records,"ObjectiveAbsent a vaccine or any established treatments for the novel and highly infectious coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), rapid efforts to identify potential therapeutics are required. We sought to identify commonly prescribed medications that may be associated with lesser risk of morbidity with COVID-19 across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals.

DesignIn silico cohort using electronic health records from individuals evaluated in the emergency department between March 4, 2020 and July 12, 2020.

SettingEmergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals.

ParticipantsAll individuals presenting to an emergency department and undergoing COVID-19 testing.

Main Outcome or MeasureInpatient hospitalization; documented requirement for mechanical ventilation.

ResultsAmong 7,360 individuals with COVID-19 positive test results by PCR, 3,693 (50.2%) were hospitalized in one of 6 hospitals. In models adjusted for sociodemographic features and overall burden of medical illness, medications significantly associated with diminished risk for hospitalization included ibuprofen and sumatriptan. Among individuals who were hospitalized, 962(26.0%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 608 (16.5%) died; ibuprofen and naproxen were also more commonly prescribed among individuals not requiring intensive care.

ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that electronic health records may be applied to identify medications associated with lower risk of morbidity with COVID-19, but larger cohorts will be required to address the substantial problem of confounding by indication, such that extreme caution is warranted in interpreting nonrandomized results.

14,4576,Epidemic Landscape and Forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 in India,"BACKGROUNDIndia was one of the countries to institute strict measures for SARS-CoV-2 control in early phase. Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions.

METHODSWe estimated growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowd sourced time series data. Further, we also estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and time dependent reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models.

RESULTSOn an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14 {+/-} 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% of population likely to be infected at the peak time.

CONCLUSIONSThe pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase fund for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a medicine.",17/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.14.20065151,Muhammed Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya,"School of Public Health, Boston University, MA, USA",medrxiv,0,0
15,4749,"Epidemiological and Genomic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Ten Patients from a Mid-sized City outside of Hubei, China in the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak","A novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we performed a comprehensive epidemiological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from ten patients in Shaoxing, a mid-sized city outside of the epicenter Hubei province, China, during the early stage of the outbreak (late January to early February, 2020). We obtained viral genomes with > 99% coverage and a mean depth of 296X demonstrating that viral genomic analysis is feasible via metagenomics sequencing directly on nasopharyngeal samples with SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR Ct values less than 28. We found that a cluster of 4 patients with travel history to Hubei shared the exact same virus with patients from Wuhan, Taiwan, Belgium and Australia, highlighting how quickly this virus spread to the globe. The virus from another cluster of two family members living together without travel history but with a sick contact of a confirmed case from another city outside of Hubei accumulated significantly more mutations (9 SNPs vs average 4 SNPs), suggesting a complex and dynamic nature of this outbreak. We also found 70% patients in this study had the S genotype, consistent with an early study showing a higher prevalence of genotype out of Hubei than that inside Hubei. We calculated an average mutation rate of 1.37x10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year, which is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Our findings add to the growing knowledge of the epidemiological and genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 that are important for guiding outbreak containment and vaccine development. The moderate mutation rate of this virus also lends hope that development of an effective, long-lasting vaccine may be possible.",02/06/2020,10.1101/2020.04.16.20058560,Shangxin Yang,UCLA Health System,medrxiv,0,0
16,4831,Review of Current Evidence of Hydroxychloroquine in Pharmacotherapy of COVID-19,"ImportanceThe COVID-19 Pandemic has literally left the world breathless in the chase for pharmacotherapy. With vaccine and novel drug development in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage.

ObjectiveA potential drug discussed in global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine. We intend to systematically explore, analyze, rate the existing evidence of hydroxychloroquine in the light of published, unpublished and clinical trial data.

Evidence reviewPubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases, pre-proof article repositories, clinical trial registries were comprehensively searched with focused question of use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. The literature was systematically explored as per PRISMA guidelines.

FindingsTotal 156 articles were available as of 7th May 2020; of which 11 articles of relevance were analyzed. Three in-vitro studies were reviewed. Two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one large observational study, one follow-up study and two retrospective cohort studies were systematically analyzed and rated by oxford CEBM and GRADE framework for quality and strength of evidence. Also 27 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed and summarized. Hydroxychloroquine seems to be efficient in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines. However, there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. It was found that overall quality of available evidence ranges from  very low to  low.

Conclusions and relevanceThe in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Current literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the current evidence for use of Hydroxychloroquine in pharmacotherapy of COVID-19?

FindingsWe electronically explored various databases and clinical trial registries and identified 11 publications and 27 clinical trials with active recruitment. The in-vitro study data demonstrates the viral inhibition by hydroxychloroquine. The clinical studies are weakly designed and conducted with insufficient reporting and significant limitations. Well designed robust clinical trials are being conducted all over the world and results of few such robust studies are expected shortly.

17,4936,Self-burnout - a new path to the end of COVID-19,"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe a possible route to the end of COVID-19, which does not feature either vaccination or herd immunity. We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the regions population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.",28/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069443,B Shayak,Cornell University,medrxiv,0,0
18,5092,Immune defects and cardiovascular risk in X chromosome monosomy mosaicism mediated by loss of chromosome Y. A risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 vulnerability in elderly men?,"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) has an estimated overall case fatality ratio of 1.38% in China, being 53% higher in males and increasing exponentially with age. Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down-regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10-7), mainly interferon-induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease.",24/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.19.20071357,Juan R Gonzalez,Barcelona Institute for Global Health,medrxiv,0,0
19,5038,"Evidence-Based, Cost-Effective Interventions To Suppress The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","BackgroundIn an unparalleled global response, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 90 countries asked 3.9 billion people to stay home. Yet some countries avoided lockdowns and focused on other strategies, like contact tracing and case isolation. How effective and cost-effective are these strategies? We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on pandemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness.

MethodsFollowing PRISMA systematic review guidelines, MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2020) and Embase (1974 to April 17, 2020) were searched using a range of terms related to pandemic control. Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher-quality evidence (randomized trials) and lower-quality evidence (other study designs).

ResultsWe found 1,653 papers; 62 were included. Higher-quality evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies indicated that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other interventions, lower-quality evidence suggested that: (1) the most cost-effective interventions are swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost-effective; (3) social distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost-effective options; (4) combinations are more cost-effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost-effective when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented).

ConclusionsA cautious interpretation of the evidence suggests that for COVID-19: (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, ample protective equipment for healthcare workers, and swift contact tracing and case isolation is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.

20,5275,Long period dynamics of viral load and antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 infection: an observational cohort study,"OBJECTIVETo investigate the dynamics of viral RNA, IgM, and IgG and their relationships in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia over an 8-week period.

DESIGNRetrospective, observational case series.

SETTINGWenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital

PARTICIPANTSThirty-three patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to hospital. Data were collected from January 27 to April 10, 2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThroat swabs, sputum, stool, and blood samples were collected, and viral load was measured by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific IgM and IgG against spike protein (S), spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) were analyzed.

RESULTSAt the early stages of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 viral load is higher in throat swabs and sputum, but lower in stool. The median (IQR) time of undetectable viral RNA in throat swab, sputum, and stool was 18.5 (13.25-22) days, 22 (18.5-27.5) days, and 17 (11.5-32) days, respectively. In sputum, 17 patients (51.5%) had undetectable viral RNA within 22 days (short persistence), and 16 (48.5%) had persistent viral RNA more than 22 days (long persistence). Three patients (9.1%) had a detectable relapse of viral RNA in sputum within two weeks of their discharge from the hospital. One patient had persistent viral RNA for 59 days or longer. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgM, anti-RBD IgM, and anti-N IgM was 10.5 (7.75-15.5) days, 14 (9-24) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-N IgG was 10 (7.25-16.5) days, 13 (9-17) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. By week 8 after symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels were 4-times higher in convalescence than in acute phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA coexisted with antibodies for more than 50 days. Anti-RBD IgM and IgG levels, including anti-RBD IgM levels at presentation and peak time, were significantly higher in viral RNA short persistence patients than in long persistence patients.

CONCLUSIONThis study adds important new information about the features of viral load and antibody dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It is clear from these results that the viral RNA persists in sputum and stool specimens for a relatively long time in many patients. Anti-RBD may also serve as a potential protective antibody against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as viral persistence appears to be related to anti-RBD levels. Earlier treatment intervention also appears to be a factor in viral persistence.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICThere are several reports about the serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. However, most of them evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Only two articles report dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and antibodies with serial samples, but the observation periods are within 30 days. None of the studies investigate the profiles of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and antibodies in a long period. Three reports investigate profiles in respiratory samples, but there are no reports on the dynamics of the viral load in stool samples.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSIn both sputum and stool, SARS-CoV-2 RNA persists for a long time. The anti-RBD antibodies may involve in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. After eight weeks from symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels increased 4-time higher in convalescence than in acute phase. Long persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in sputum and stool presents challenges for management of the infection. The IgM/IgG comb test is better than single IgM test as a supplement diagnostic tool. Anti-RBD may be a protective antibody, and is valuable for development of vaccines.",27/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.22.20071258,Shaohua Tang,"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital",medrxiv,0,0
21,5315,Intention to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial and to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France during the pandemic,"BackgroundThe world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of vaccine is challenging.

AimTo determine the proportion of people who intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial.

MethodsWe conducted an anonymous on-line survey from the 26th of March to the 20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical trial.

ResultsThree thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the survey; women accounted for 67.4 % of the responders, 670 (20.6 %) were under 30 years of age, 1,502 (46.1 %) between 30-49 years, 803 (24.6 %) between 50-64 years, 271 (8.3%) between 65-80 years, 13 (0.4%) over 80 years of age. According to their statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95 % CI 76.2-79 %) will certainly or probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, being healthcare workers and individual perceived risk were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred and fifty responders (47.6 % 95 % CI 45.9-49.3 %) will certainly or probably agree to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.

Conclusions and RelevanceNearly 75 % and 48 % of the survey responders were likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy will be the major barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake.",27/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.23.20076513,Amandine Gagneux-Brunon,CHU de Saint-Etienne,medrxiv,0,0
22,5574,Custommune: a web tool to design personalized and population-targeted vaccine epitopes,"Computational prediction of immunogenic epitopes is a promising platform for therapeutic and preventive vaccine design. A potential target for this strategy is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), for which, despite decades of efforts, no vaccine is available. In particular, a therapeutic vaccine devised to eliminate infected cells would represent a key component of cure strategies. HIV peptides designed based on individual viro-immunological data from people living with HIV/AIDS have recently shown able to induce post-therapy viral set point abatement. However, the reproducibility and scalability of this method is curtailed by the errors and arbitrariness associated with manual peptide design as well as by the time-consuming process.

We herein introduce Custommune, a user-friendly web tool to design personalized and population-targeted vaccines. When applied to HIV-1, Custommune predicted personalized epitopes using patient specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and viral sequences, as well as the expected HLA-peptide binding strength and potential immune escape mutations. Of note, Custommune predictions compared favorably with manually designed peptides administered in a recent phase II clinical trial (NCT02961829).

Furthermore, we utilized Custommune to design preventive vaccines targeted for populations highly affected by COVID-19. The results allowed the identification of peptides tailored for each population and predicted to elicit both CD8+ T-cell immunity and neutralizing antibodies against structurally conserved epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Overall, our data describe a new tool for rapid development of personalized or population-based immunotherapy against chronic and acute viral infections.",29/04/2020,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079426,Andrea Savarino,"Department of Infectious Diseases, Italian Institute of Health, Rome, Italy",medrxiv,0,0
23,5636,Population-scale testing can suppress the spread of COVID-19,"We propose an additional intervention that would contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, offer more protection for people working in essential jobs, and help guide an eventual reopening of society. The intervention is based on: (1) testing every individual (2) repeatedly, and (3) self-quarantine of infected individuals. Using a standard epidemiological model (SIR), we show here that by identification and isolation of the majority of infectious individuals, including those who may be asymptomatic, the reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. We replicate these observations in a more complex stochastic dynamic model on a social network graph. We also find that the testing regime would be additive to other interventions, and be effective at any level of prevalence. If adopted as a policy, any industrial society could sustain the regime for as long as it takes to find a safe and effective cure or vaccine. Our model also indicates that unlike sampling-based tests, population-scale testing does not need to be very accurate: false negative rates up to 15% could be tolerated if 80% comply with testing every ten days, and false positives can be almost arbitrarily high when a high fraction of the population is already effectively quarantined. Testing at the required scale would be feasible if existing qPCR-based methods are scaled up and multiplexed. A mass produced, low throughput field test kit could also be carried out at home. Economic analysis also supports the feasibility of the approach: current reagent costs for tests are in the range of a dollar or less, and the estimated benefits for population-scale testing are so large that the policy would be cost-effective even if the costs were larger by more than two orders of magnitude. To identify both active and previous infections, both viral RNA and antibodies could be tested. All technologies to build such test kits, and to produce them in the scale required to test the entire worlds population exist already. Integrating them, scaling up production, and implementing the testing regime will require resources and planning, but at a scale that is very small compared to the effort that every nation would devote to defending itself against a more traditional foe.",28/05/2020,10.1101/2020.04.27.20078329,Sten Linnarsson,Karolinska Institutet,medrxiv,0,0
24,6540,BCG Vaccine Protection from Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19),"A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; p = 8x10-7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating in recent history. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis also confers broad protection against other infectious diseases, and it has been proposed that it could reduce the severity of COVID-19. This epidemiological study assessed the global linkage between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality. Signals of BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. This study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.",14/06/2020,10.1101/2020.05.05.20091975,Carolina Barillas-Mury,National Institutes of Health,medrxiv,0,0
25,6526,ProgNet: Covid-19 prognosis using recurrent andconvolutional neural networks,"--Humanity is facing nowadays a dramatic pandemic episode with the Coronavirus propagation over all continents. The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either therapeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagery-based tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase.

Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology. When applied to radiological time-series, promising results are obtained with an accuracy rates higher than 92%.",08/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874,Lotfi Chaari,Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse,medrxiv,0,0

We performed a systematic literature review to identify all treatments reported to be administered to COVID19 patients and assess time to clinically meaningful response for treatments with sufficient data. We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv for articles reporting treatments for COVID19 patients published between 12/1/2019-3/27/2020. Data were analyzed descriptively. Of the 2,706 articles identified, 155 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 9,152 patients from 14 different countries.

27,6741,DOUBLE POWER LAW FOR COVID-19: PREDICTION OF NEW CASES AND DEATH RATES IN ITALY AND SPAIN,"1.The novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 appeared at the end of 2019, spreading rapidly and causing a severe respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) with high mortality (2-5%). Until a vaccine or therapy is found, the most effective method of prophylaxis has been to minimize transmission via rigorous social distancing and seclusion of all but essential workers. Such measures, implemented at different times and to varying degrees world-wide, have reduced the rate of transmission compared with early phases of the pandemic, resulting in ""flattening of the curve"" followed by a gradual reduction in mortality after >6 weeks of rigorous social distancing measures. The cost of rigorous social distancing has been seen in radically reduced economic activity, job losses, disruption of schooling and social institutions. A key question facing policy makers and individuals is when to resume normal economic and social activity in the face of persistent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To help address this question, we have developed a model that accurately describes the entire transmission and mortality curves in Italy and Spain, two hard-hit countries that have maintained severe social distancing measures for over 2 months. Our model quantitatively describes the rapid rise and slow decay of new cases and deaths observed under stringent social distancing (the ""long tail"" effect). We predict that even when social distancing is rigorously maintained, the number of COVID-19 deaths after peak mortality may be 2 - 3 times larger than the total number of deaths up to the peak. Our model has important policy implications for countries currently debating how to ease social distancing measures.",23/10/2020,10.1101/2020.05.07.20094714,Lev Z.

28,6965,Health literacy of inland population in the mitigation phase 3.2. of COVID-19's pandemic in Portugal - a descriptive cohort study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted through respiratory droplets with a high transmission rate. Theres still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, thus, preventive measures are the main key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and how to prevent the lack of information, through community empowerment.

Material and methodsA cross-sectional study with a cohort from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.

ResultsOur cohort includes 222 subjects (median age: 62 years old), mostly females (131), undergraduate (193) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (144). Globally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group appear to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions to this pattern.

ConclusionsWe observe a well-informed population. However, being a pandemic situation, we intend to identify and correct outliers/misconceptions. This work allows a perspective of the current state/pattern of health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, this study makes aware of how relevant the specific communication approaches are. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are necessary.",14/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.11.20098061,Joana Gomes Da Silva,Centro de Saude Mirandela II,medrxiv,0,0
29,7070,Country-level Determinants of the Severity of the First Global Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Ecological Study,"ObjectiveWe aimed to identify the country-level determinants of the severity of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignAn ecological study design of publicly available data was employed. Countries reporting >25 COVID-related deaths until 08/06/2020 were included. The outcome was log mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential determinants assessed were most recently published demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, median age, average body mass index, smoking prevalence), Economic parameters (Gross Domestic Product per capita); environmental parameters: pollution levels, mean temperature (January-May)), co-morbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer), health system parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10,000 population); international arrivals, the stringency index, as a measure of country-level response to COVID-19, BCG vaccination coverage, UV radiation exposure and testing capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data.

Primary OutcomeCountry-level mean mortality rate: the mean slope of the COVID-19 mortality curve during its ascending phase.

ParticipantsThirty-seven countries were included: Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.

ResultsOf all country-level predictors included in the multivariable model, total number of international arrivals (beta 0.033 (95% Confidence Interval 0.012,0.054)) and BCG vaccination coverage (-0.018 (-0.034,-0.002)), were significantly associated with the mean death rate.

ConclusionsInternational travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Very early restrictions on international travel should be considered to control COVID outbreak and prevent related deaths.

ARTICLE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSStrengths and limitationsC_ST_ABSO_LIA comparable and relevant outcome variable quantifying country-level increases in the COVID-19 death rate was derived which is largely independent of different testing policies adopted by each country
C_LIO_LIOur multivariable regression models accounted for public health and economic measures which were adopted by each country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by adjusting for the Stringency Index
C_LIO_LIThe main limitation of the study stems from the ecological study design which does not allow for conclusions to be drawn for individual COVID-19 patients
C_LIO_LIOnly countries that had reported at least 25 daily deaths over the analysed period were included, which reduced our sample and consequently the power.

30,7174,Proinflammatory IgG Fc structures in patients with severe COVID-19,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused a public health crisis that is exacerbated by our poor understanding of correlates of immunity. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic carriage to life threatening pneumonia and cytokine dysregulation [1-3]. Although antibodies have been shown in a variety of in vitro assays to promote coronavirus infections through mechanisms requiring interactions between IgG antibodies and Fc gamma receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs), the relevance of these observations to coronavirus infections in humans is not known [4-7]. In light of ongoing clinical trials examining convalescent serum therapy for COVID-19 patients and expedited SARS-CoV-2 vaccine testing in humans, it is essential to clarify the role of antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we show that adults with PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 produce IgG antibodies with a specific Fc domain repertoire that is characterized by reduced fucosylation, a modification that enhances interactions with the activating Fc{gamma}R, Fc{gamma}RIIIa. Fc fucosylation was reduced when compared with SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children and relative to adults with symptomatic influenza virus infections. These results demonstrate an antibody correlate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting Fc{gamma}RIIIa pathways.",10/11/2020,10.1101/2020.05.15.20103341,Taia T.

31,7568,Immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 spike in individuals recovered from COVID-19,"The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant mortality and social disruption have highlighted the need to better understand coronavirus immunity to expedite vaccine development efforts. Multiple candidate vaccines, designed to elicit protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein, are rapidly advancing to clinical trial. However, the immunogenic properties of the spike protein in humans are unresolved. To address this, we undertook an in-depth characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike in humans following mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find serological antibody responses against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising activity and capacity to block ACE2/RBD interaction. Expanded populations of spike-specific memory B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) were detected within convalescent donors, while responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) constitute a minor fraction. Using regression analysis, we find high plasma neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody, but notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets. Thus both qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immunity to spike constitute informative biomarkers of the protective potential of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",21/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.17.20104869,Adam K Wheatley,University of Melbourne,medrxiv,0,0
32,8054,Tensions between research and public health: modelling the risks and benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine field trials versus human infection challenge studies.,"BackgroundHuman infection challenge studies (HICS) with SARS-CoV-2 are under consideration as a way of accelerating vaccine development. We evaluate potential vaccine research strategies under a range of epidemic conditions determined, in part, by the intensity of public health interventions.

MethodsWe constructed a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating public health interventions, vaccine efficacy trials and a post-trial population vaccination campaign. The model was used to estimate the duration and benefits of large-scale field trials in comparison with HICS accompanied by an expanded safety trial, and to assess the marginal risk faced by HICS participants.

ResultsField trials may demonstrate vaccine efficacy more rapidly than a HICS strategy under epidemic conditions consistent with moderate mitigation policies. A HICS strategy is the only feasible option for testing vaccine efficacy under epidemic suppression, and maximises the benefits of post-trial vaccination. Less successful or absent mitigation results in minimal or no benefit from post-trial vaccination, irrespective of trial design.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 HICS are the optimal method of vaccine testing for populations maintained under epidemic suppression, where vaccination offers the greatest benefits to the local population.",27/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.18.20106187,George S Heriot,Monash University,medrxiv,0,0
33,8022,"Mechanistic rationale of drugs, Primary endpoints, Geographical distribution of clinical trials against Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2: A Systematic Review","ObjectiveTo do a systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials that are assessing various therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 with an aim to provide insight into the various interventions tested, clinical rationale, geographical distribution of the trials as well as the endpoints assessed in the studies.

DesignRapid systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2.

Data sourcesClinicalTrials.gov, World health organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Cochrane COVID registry were assessed till May 11th 2020.

Study selectionStudies on any intervention based randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective clinical studies on SARS-CoV-2 in patients [&ge;]18 years of age. Studies on autopsy series, preclinical studies, diagnostic methods, mathematical modelling, epidemiology and health services research, pediatric populations were excluded.

Data extractionThe data was extracted by two authors independently into pre-defined forms based on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The data was extracted on various domains such as trial number, study title, abstract of the study, interventions assessed, sample size, phase of the study, study sponsor, primary endpoint assessed and country of study.

ResultsThe search resulted in 3242 ongoing studies of which 829 studies were included. There are 134 different drug-based interventions being assessed in 463 clinical trials as treatment options. Seventy-two studies assessed preventive options of which 53 are drug-based prophylaxis and 19 assessed vaccines. Herbal medicines are being assessed in 79 studies; convalescent plasma therapy in 56 studies; stem cell-based interventions in 42 studies; anesthesia-based interventions in 31 studies, machine-based interventions in 24 studies, mental health-based interventions in18 studies, rehabilitation-based interventions in 12 studies and miscellaneous interventions in 32 studies. China accounts for 35% of all ongoing clinical studies followed by USA 23%, France 7%, Spain 3.3%,Canada 2%, multi-country studies account only for 1.5% (13) and other countries together account for 28%.Amongst the 463 studies assessing drug-based treatment options, studies that are funded by federal and academic institutions are 79.6%, pharmaceutical company funded studies are 15.11% and no funding information is available in 5.10%. The definitive outcomes like mortality are being assessed as primary outcome in 22.8% of the studies only and need for ventilator in 6.2% of the studies. Rest of the studies has primary outcomes such as clinical recovery (15.9%), viral clearance(17.4%), time to recovery (10.1%), oxygen improvement (5.6%), ICU admission (1.9%), lab and imaging(6.4%), adverse effects (5.3%) and symptom reduction(1.5%),no outcome reported(6.2%) which account for 71% of the studies. Amongst the pharmaceutical company funded drug-based studies, only 20% of the studies had mortality as the primary outcome. Only 5.5% of the ongoing clinical trials are specifically designed to assess the most vulnerable population like elderly, patients with comorbidities and cancer. The most common intervention being tested against COVID-19 are antimalarial medications with 105 clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine is the most common drug being tested with 83 ongoing studies.

ConclusionMultiple intervention based clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2 are being performed throughout the world with a high concentration of clinical trials in the developed world. There is a high concern that most of the studies maybe repetitive; elderly and patients with comorbidities are being underrepresented; definite endpoints like mortality are being assessed in only one-fifth of the studies.",26/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.24.20112169,Bhanu Prasad Venkatesulu,Henry Ford Hospital,medrxiv,0,0
34,8192,Improved detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 by microsphere-based antibody assay,"ObjectiveCurrently available COVID-19 antibody tests using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunochromatographic assay have variable sensitivity and specificity. Here, we developed and evaluated a novel microsphere-based antibody assay (MBA) for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD).

MethodWe developed a microsphere-based assay (MBA) to determine the levels of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 NP and spike RBD. The seropositive cut-off mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was set using a cohort of 294 anonymous serum specimens collected in 2018. The specificity was assessed using serum specimens collected from organ donors or influenza patients before 2020. Seropositive rate was determined among patients with COVID-19. Time-to-seropositivity and signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio were compared between MBA and EIA.

ResultsMBA had a specificity of 100% (93/93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96-100%) for anti-NP IgG and 98.9% (92/93; 95% CI 94.2-100%) for anti-RBD IgG. The MBA seropositive rate for convalescent serum specimens of COVID-19 patients were 89.8% (35/39) for anti-NP IgG and 79.5% (31/39) for anti-RBD IgG. The time-to-seropositivity was shorter with MBA than that of EIA. When compared with EIA, MBA could better differentiate between COVID-19 patients and negative controls with significantly higher S/CO ratio for COVID-19 patients and lower S/CO ratio with negative controls. MBA also had fewer specimens in the equivocal range (S/CO 0.9-1.1) than EIA.

ConclusionMBA is robust and simple, and is suitable for clinical microbiology laboratory for the accurate determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody for retrospective diagnosis, serosurveillance, and vaccine trials.",26/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.26.20113191,Kelvin Kai-Wang To,University of Hong Kong,medrxiv,0,0
35,8254,The Potential Impact of Intensified Community Hand Hygiene Interventions on Respiratory tract Infections: A Modelling Study,"Increased hand hygiene amongst the general public has been widely promoted as one of the most important non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing transmission during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and is likely to continue to play a key role in long-term efforts to suppress transmission before a vaccine can be deployed. For other respiratory tract infections community hand hygiene interventions are supported by evidence from randomised trials, but information on how effectiveness in reducing transmission scales with achieved changes in hand hygiene behaviour is lacking. This information is of critical importance when considering the potential value of substantially enhancing community hand hygiene frequency to help suppress COVID-19. Here, we developed a simple model-based framework for understanding the key determinants of the effectiveness of changes in hand hygiene behaviour in reducing transmission and use it to explore the potential impact of interventions aimed at achieving large-scale population-wide changes in hand hygiene behaviour. Our analyses show that the effect of hand hygiene is highly dependent on the duration of viral persistence on hands and that hand washing needs to be performed very frequently or immediately after hand contamination events in order to substantially reduce the probability of infection. Hand washing at a lower frequency, such as every 30 minutes or with a delay of 15 minutes after contamination events, may be adequate to reduce the probability of infection when viral survival on hands is longer, such as when hands are contaminated with mucus. Immediate hand washing after contamination is more effective than hand washing at fixed-time intervals even when the total number of hand washing events is similar. This event-prompted hand washing strategy is consistently more effective than fixed-time strategy regardless of hand contamination rates and should be highlighted in hand hygiene campaigns.",27/05/2020,10.1101/2020.05.26.20113464,Thi Mui Pham,Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care of the UMC Utrecht,medrxiv,0,0
36,8701,THE TIME TO OFFER TREATMENT FOR COVID-19,"BACKGROUNDThe spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan China, has been alarmingly rapid. Epidemiologic techniques succeeded in containing the disease in China, but efforts have not been as successful in the rest of the World, with a total of 29,155,581 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 926,544 deaths worldwide as of September 15, 2020. Projections are for continued new infections and deaths if no effective therapeutic interventions can be initiated over the next several months. We performed a systematic review to determine the potential time course for development of treatments and vaccines, focusing on availability now and continuing in the last half of 2020.

METHODS

Clinical TrialsWe reviewed up-to-date information from several sources to identify potential treatments for COVID-19: The Reagan-Udall Expanded Access Navigator COVID-19 Treatment Hub was used to track the efforts of companies to develop agents. We focused on trials completed as of September 1, 2020 on identified agents We used several different sources: (A) covid-trials.org, then validated results on (B) clinicaltrials.gov and the (C) World Health Organizations International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). We excluded studies which were clearly observational, with no randomization, control, or comparison group. We further set a cutoff of 100 for numbers of subjects, since smaller trial size could lack statistical power to establish superiority of the intervention over the control.

PublicationsWe searched for published trial results on pubmed.gov and on medRxiv, the preprint server, and used a targeted Google search to find announcements of unpublished trial results

RESULTS

Clinical Trials in RecruitmentAs of our cutoff date of April 1, 2020, we found 409 trials meeting our minimum requirement of 100 subjects. The WHO Solidarity megatrial for hospitalized patients was launched in over 100 countries, actively comparing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopanovir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone and in combination with interferon beta-1, and remdesivir. The LPV/r alone and HCQ arms have already been discontinued. Of these, only 9 were conducted on outpatients. A few vaccine trials are hoping to complete Phase 3 enrollment by the end of the third quarter 2020, but a prolonged follow-up of patients will likely be required.

Clinical trials CompletedAs of September 1, 2020, there were 231 trials reporting completion, Of these, only 59 studies enrolled 100 or more subjects. There were 34 trials in hospitalized patients, 9 directed at outpatients, and 8 prevention studies,

Published DataAs of September 1, 2020 we found 70 publications reporting findings in human studies on 13 classes of drugs and on 6 vaccines. There were 33 randomized placebo or active control studies; the rest were retrospective observational. Only seven publications dealt with outpatient care, the rest all in hospitalized patients.

Available TreatmentsAt this time, remdesivir and convalescent plasma have been granted emergency use authorization in the U.S.A., solely for hospitalized patients. There is also support for glucocorticoid treatment of the COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome. No treatments or prophylaxis are offered for outpatients.

CONCLUSIONCOVID-19 is propagated primarily by infected ambulatory individuals. There have been no options brought forward for prevention and non-hospital treatment with only a few randomized, controlled outpatient studies expected to yield results in time to impact on the continuing pandemic by the end of 2020. It will be necessary for public health authorities to make hard decisions, with limited data, to prevent the continued spread of the disease. The choices will be hardest when dealing with possible early release of safe and effective vaccines which would, of course, be of greatest benefit to the Worlds population.",23/01/2021,10.1101/2020.05.27.20115238,Marc Rendell,The Rose Salter Medical Research Foundation,medrxiv,0,0
37,8792,Repurposed prophylaxis strategies for COVID-19: a systematic review,"IntroductionEfficient therapeutic strategies are needed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARSCoV-2 virus. In a context where specific vaccines are not yet available, the containment of the pandemic would be facilitated with efficient prophylaxis.

MethodsWe screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020.

ResultsUp to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n = 43, 63%), patients relatives (n = 16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n = 5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n = 46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n = 5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515).

ConclusionThe investigated prophylaxis strategies cover both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and study numerous immune enhancers and antivirals, although most research efforts are focused on (hydroxy)chloroquine.",03/06/2020,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117937,Nathan Peiffer-Smadja,"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau",medrxiv,0,0
38,9236,Serological Assays Estimate Highly Variable SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Activity in Recovered COVID19 Patients,"The development of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against SARS-CoV-2, following infection or vaccination, is likely to be critical for the development of sufficient population immunity to drive cessation of the COVID19 pandemic. A large number of serologic tests, platforms and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasmas for therapeutic trials, and to guide policies about reopening. However, tests have substantial variability in sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of nAb is unknown. We collected 370 unique donors enrolled in the New York Blood Center Convalescent Plasma Program between April and May of 2020. We measured levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house ELISA assays and correlated serological measurements with nAb activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection. Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have varying degrees of accuracy in predicting nAb activity. We found the Ortho Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Ig and IgG high throughput serological assays (HTSAs), as well as the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, quantify levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with nAb assays and are consistent with gold-standard ELISA assay results. These findings provide immediate clinical relevance to serology results that can be equated to nAb activity and could serve as a valuable  roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.",09/09/2020,10.1101/2020.06.08.20124792,Larry L Luchsinger,New York Blood Center,medrxiv,0,0
39,9395,Pre exposure Hydroxychloroquine use is associated with reduced COVID19 risk in healthcare workers - a Retrospective cohort,"BackgroundWhile several trials are ongoing for treatment of COVID-19, scientific research on chemoprophylaxis is still lacking even though it has potential to delay the pandemic allowing us time to complete research on vaccines.

MethodsWe have conducted a cohort study amongst Health Care Workers (HCW) exposed to COVID-19 patients, at a tertiary care center in India where there was an abrupt cluster outbreak within on duty personnel. HCWs who had voluntarily taken hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prior to exposure were considered one cohort while those who had not were considered to be another. All participants with a verifiable contact history were tested for COVID-19 by rtPCR. The two cohorts were comparable in terms of age, gender, comorbidities and exposure. The primary outcome was incidence rates of rtPCR positive COVID-19 infection amongst HCQ users and non users.

Results106 healthcare workers were examined in this cohort study of whom 54 were HCQ users and rest were not. The comparative analysis of incidence of infection between the two groups demonstrated that voluntary HCQ usage was associated with lesser likelihood of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it, X2=14.59, p<0.001. None of the HCQ users noted any serious adverse effects.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that voluntary HCQ consumption as pre-exposure prophylaxis by HCWs is associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2. These promising findings therefore highlight the need to examine this association in greater detail among a larger sample using Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT).",01/10/2020,10.1101/2020.06.09.20116806,Anita Nandi,Medical College Kolkata,medrxiv,0,0
40,9663,Global research trend in the treatment of the new Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) : bibliometric analysis.,"The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused worldwide concern and has become a major medical problem. Vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of this outbreak. This study aims to used bibliometric methods to identify research trends in the domain of therapeutics and vaccines to cure patients with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.

The Web of Science Core Collection database was retrieved for articles on therapeutic approaches to coronavirus disease management published between January 1, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Identified and analyzed the data included title, corresponding author, language, publication time, publication type, research focus.

A total of 1569 articles on coronavirus therapeutic means from 84 countries were published in 620 journals. We note the remarkable progressive increase in the number of publications related to research on therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. The United States provided the largest number of articles (405), followed by China (364). Journal of Medical Virology published most of them (n = 40). 1005 (64.05%) were articles, 286 (18.23%) were letters, 230 (14.66%) were reviews. The terms ""COVID- 19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""Coronavirus"" or ""hydroxychloroquine"" or ""chloroquine"" or ""2019-nCOV"" or ""ACE2"" or ""treatment"" or ""remdesivir"" or ""pneumonia"" were most frequently used, as shown in the density visualization map. A network analysis based on keyword co-occurrence revealed five distinct types of studies: clinical, biological, epidemiological, pandemic management, and therapeutics (vaccines and treatments).

COVID-19 is a major disease that has had an impact on international public health at the global level. Several avenues for treatment and vaccines have been explored. Most of them focus on older drugs used to treat other diseases that have been effective for other types of coronaviruses. There is a discrepancy in the results obtained from the studies of the drugs included in this study. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate older drugs and develop new treatment options.",14/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.13.20122762,Maxime Descartes Mbogning Fonkou,Aix Marseille Universite,medrxiv,0,0
41,9799,"Explore the Possible Impact of BCG Vaccination Policy on the Morbidity, Mortality, and Recovery Rates due to COVID-19 Infection.","BACKGROUNDThe Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world. Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity/mortality/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection.

METHODSData of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates.

RESULTSAmong those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively.

CONCLUSIONSThat data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery. BCG vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease-specific vaccine is developed, but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials.",18/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.14.20131268,Yue-Cune Chang,Tamkang University,medrxiv,0,0
42,9911,A longitudinal study of immune cells in severe COVID-19 patients.,"Little is known about the time-dependent immune responses in severe COVID-19. Data of 15 consecutive patients were sequentially recorded from intensive care unit admission. Lymphocyte subsets and total monocyte and subsets counts were monitored as well as the expression of HLA-DR. For 5 patients, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was assessed against Spike and Nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Non-specific inflammation markers were increased in all patients. Median monocyte HLA-DR expression was below the 8,000 AB/C threshold defining acquired immunodepression. A ""V"" trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11-14 after symptoms onset. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes. Polyfunctional SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 T-cells were present and functional, whereas virus-specific CD8 T-cells were less frequent and not efficient. We report a temporal variation of both innate and adaptive immunity in severe COVID-19 patients, helpful in guiding therapeutic decisions (e.g. anti-inflammatory vs. immunostimulatory ones). We describe a defect in virus-specific CD8 T-cells, a potential biomarker of clinical severity. These combined data also provide helpful knowledge for vaccine design.

43,9944,Efficacy and Safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundSince the emergence of COVID-19, the world has been desperate to find effective therapeutics and vaccinations to treat hundreds of thousands of affected patients and to suppress the spread of this global pandemic. Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/RTV) is an HIV antiviral combination that has been considered for treatment of this disease.

Aim of the studyThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients in the extant published research. A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA statement. Published English and non-English articles written since December 1, 2019 were selected for review from 8 electronic databases.

Readily accessible full articles (cohort studies and clinical trials) which specifically mentioned lopinavir/ritonavir and patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or COVOID-19 of any age were included. Three researchers separately evaluated the bias in the reported articles. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objective of evaluation of the safety and efficacy of LPV/RTV alone or in combination with other drugs with regard to time to becoming PCR negative, time to body temperature normalization and cough relief, radiological progression, and safety. Review Manager (RevMan) was used to conduct all statistical analyses and generate the forest plots. Meta-analyses were performed using the Mantel Hazel method or the inverse variance method for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively.

ResultsNon-duplicate articles (n=76) were evaluated for possible inclusion. A consensus was reached to select 29 articles for full-text screening, only 11 articles comprised 1,192 patients were included in this study, and six of which were included for meta-analysis.

In terms of virological cure (PCR negative), three studies reported less time in days to achieve a virological cure for LPV/RTV arm relative to no antiviral therapy (conventional) (mean difference = -0.81 day; 95% CI, -4.44 to 2.81; P = 0.007, I2 = 80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (P = 0.66). When comparing LPV/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm, but not statically significant (mean difference = 0.95 day; 95% CI, -1.11 to 3.01; P = 0.09, I2 = 58%).

In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief (clinical cure), two studies reported on time to temperature normalization with no significant effect of LPV/RTV (n = 93) versus umifenovir (n = 71) arm), (OR = 0.87 day; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.78; (P = 0.70), I2 = 0%), or alleviation of cough duration (p = 0.69).

In terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia/lung damage, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in no significant decrease in the radiological progression (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.54; P = 0.59, I2 = 81%), In terms of safety, a greater number of adverse events were reported for lopinavir/ritonavir (n=45) relative to the umifenovir arm (n=14) and conventional treatments (n=10), P = 0.004, 0,0007, respectively

ConclusionsThe small number of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study did not reveal any statistically significant advantage in efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients, over conventional or other antiviral treatments. This result might not reflect the actual evidence.",19/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.16.20133298,Mansour Tobaiqy,"Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",medrxiv,0,0
44,10181,Clinical predictors of donor antibody titer and correlation with recipient antibody response in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma clinical trial,"BackgroundConvalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on the transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial.

MethodsMultivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19.

FindingsMean symptom duration of plasma donors was 11.9{+/-}5.9 days and 7.8% (8/103) had been hospitalized. Antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:3,892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1:3,289 (anti-spike). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titer were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever, and absence of myalgia (all p<0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (p=0.03) but not anti-spike antibody titer (p=0.11). In pairwise comparison among ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD titer than O negative donors (p=0.048) and higher anti-spike titer than O negative (p=0.015) or O positive (p=0.037) donors. Eight of the ten recipients were discharged, one remains on ECMO and one died on ECMO. No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. After excluding two ECMO patients and adjusting for donor antibody titer, recipient anti-RBD antibody titer increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (p=0.01) and anti-spike antibody titer by 40.3% (p=0.02).

InterpretationAdvanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titer to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titer, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion among COVID-19 patients is needed to determine the clinical efficacy of this therapy.

45,10326,"Current infection control behaviour patterns in the UK, and how they can be improved by 'Germ Defence', an online behavioural intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the home.","BackgroundGerm Defence (https://germdefence.org/) is a freely available website providing behavioural advice for infection control within households, using behaviour change techniques. This observational study reports current infection control behaviours in the home in UK and international users of the website, and examine how they might be improved to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Method28,285 users sought advice from four website pathways (to protect themselves generally, to protect others if the user was showing symptoms, to protect themselves if household members were showing symptoms, and to protect a household member who is at high risk) and completed outcome measures of current infection control behaviours within the home (self-isolation, social distancing, putting shopping/packages aside, wearing face-covering, cleaning and disinfecting, handwashing), and intentions to change these behaviours.

ResultsCurrent user behaviours mean scores varied across all infection control measures but were between  sometimes and  quite often, except handwashing ( very often). Behaviours were similar regardless of the website pathway used. After using Germ Defence, users recorded intentions to improve infection control behaviour across all website pathways and for all behaviours.

ConclusionsSelf-reported infection control behaviours other than handwashing are lower than is optimal for infection prevention, although reported handwashing is much higher. The advice using behaviour change techniques in Germ Defence led to intentions to improve these behaviours. This has been shown previously to reduce the incidence, severity and transmission of infections. These findings suggest that promoting Germ Defence within national and local public health guidance could reduce COVID-19 transmission.

46,10254,BCG vaccination in infancy does not protect against COVID-19. Evidence from a natural experiment in Sweden.,"BackgroundThe Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2%, thus allowing us to estimate the BCGs effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons.

MethodsNumbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial.

ResultsThe odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0{middle dot}9997 (CI95: [0{middle dot}8002-1{middle dot}1992]) and 1{middle dot}1931 (CI95: [0{middle dot}7558-1{middle dot}6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24%

ConclusionsWhile the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.",23/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.22.20137802,Clement De Chaisemartin,UC Santa Barbara,medrxiv,0,0
47,10401,Phylogenomics and phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 retrieved genomes from India,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is one of the biggest outbreaks after the Spanish flu of 1918. Understanding the epidemiology of viral outbreaks is the first step towards vaccine development programs. This is the first phylodynamics study attempted on of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India to infer its current evolution in the context of an ongoing pandemic. Out of 286 retrieved SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes from India, 138 haplotypes were generated and analyzed. Median-joining network was built to investigate the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in India. The BDSIR package of BEAST2 was used to calculate the reproduction number (R0) and the infectious rate of the virus. Past and current population trend was investigated using the stamp date method in coalescent Bayesian skyline plot, implemented in BEAST2 and by exponential growth prior in BEAST 1.10.4. Median-joining network reveals two distinct ancestral clusters A and B showing genetic affinities with Wuhan outbreak sample. The network also illustrates the autochthonous development of isolates in a few instances. High basic reproduction number of SARS-nCoV-2 in India points towards the phase of active community transmission. The Bayesian skyline plot revel exponential rise in the effective population size (Ne) of Indian isolates from the first week of January to the first week of April 2020. More genome sequencing and analyses of the virus will be required in coming days to monitor COVID19 after the upliftment of lock down in India.",26/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.23.20138222,Mumtaz Baig,"Department of Zoology, Laboratory of Molecular and Conservation Genetics, Govt.

48,10277,HAS COUNTRYWIDE LOCKDOWN WORKED AS A FEASIBLE MEASURE IN BENDING THE COVID-19 CURVE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?,"In the absence of any effective vaccine and clinically proven treatment, experts thought that strict lockdown measures could be an effective way to slow down the spread of novel coronavirus. Despite the strict lockdown measures in several developing countries, the number of newly infected cases is getting unbridled as time progresses. This anomaly ignites questions about the effectiveness of the prolonged strict confinement measures. In light of the above view, with an aim to find the answer to this question, trends of four epidemiological parameters: growth factor of daily reported COVID-19 cases, daily incidence proportion, daily cumulative index and effective reproduction number in five developing countries named Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Pakistan and South Africa have been analysed meticulously considering the different phases of their national lockdowns. Any compelling evidence has not been found in favor of countrywide lockdown effectiveness in the above-mentioned countries. Numerical results illustrate that stringent nationwide lockdown measures have failed bringing the epidemic threshold (Re) of COVID-19 under unity. In addition, citizens of the aforementioned countries have been struggling with catastrophic socio-economic consequences due to prolonged confinement measures. Our study suggests that a new policy should be proposed for developing countries to battle against future disease outbreaks ensuring a perfect balance between saving lives and confirming livelihoods.",24/06/2020,10.1101/2020.06.23.20138685,Khondoker Nazmoon Nabi,Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology,medrxiv,0,0
49,10473,A Metapopulation Network Model for the Spreading of SARS-CoV-2: Case Study for Ireland,"We present preliminary results on an all-Ireland network modelling approach to simulate the spreading the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly known as the coronavirus. In the model, nodes correspond to locations or communities that are connected by links indicating travel and commuting between different locations. While this proposed modelling framework can be applied on all levels of spatial granularity and different countries, we consider Ireland as a case study. The network comprises 3440 electoral divisions (EDs) of the Republic of Ireland and 890 superoutput areas (SOAs) for Northern Ireland, which corresponds to local administrative units below the NUTS 3 regions. The local dynamics within each node follows a phenomenological SIRX compartmental model including classes of Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered and Quarantined (X) inspired from Science 368, 742 (2020). For better comparison to empirical data, we extended that model by a class of Deaths. We consider various scenarios including the 5-phase roadmap for Ireland. In addition, as proof of concept, we investigate the effect of dynamic interventions that aim to keep the number of infected below a given threshold. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting containment measures on a national scale, which could also be implemented at a regional (county) or local (ED/SOA) level. We find that - in principle - dynamic interventions are capable to limit the impact of future waves of outbreaks, but on the downside, in the absence of a vaccine, such a strategy can last several years until herd immunity is reached.",16/01/2021,10.1101/2020.06.26.20140590,Philipp Hoevel,"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork",medrxiv,0,0
50,10498,Cost Benefit Analysis of Limited Reopening Relative to a Herd Immunity Strategy or Shelter in Place for SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,"BackgroundFierce debate about the health and financial tradeoffs presented by different COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies highlights the need for rigorous quantitative evaluation of policy options.

ObjectiveTo quantify the economic value of the costs and benefits of a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to alternative COVID-19 response strategies in the United States.

DesignWe estimate the number and value of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from mortality averted, with a value of $125,000 per QALY, and compare these benefits to the associated costs in terms of plausible effects on US GDP under a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to a policy of full reopening toward herd immunity. Using the same QALY value assumptions, we further evaluate cost-effectiveness of a return to Shelter-in-Place relative to a policy of limited reopening.

SettingUnited States

MeasurementsQALY and cost as percent of GDP of limited reopening with continued social distancing relative to a strategy of full reopening aimed at achieving herd immunity; a limited reopening ""budget"" measured in the number of months before this strategy fails to demonstrate cost-effectiveness relative to a full reopening; a shelter-in-place ""threshold"" measured in the number of lives saved at which a month of sheltering in place demonstrates cost effectiveness relative to the limited reopening strategy.

ResultsQALY benefits from mortality averted by continued social distancing and limited reopening relative to a policy of full reopening exceed projected GDP costs if an effective vaccine or therapeutic can be developed within 11.1 months from late May 2020. White House vaccine projections fall within this date, supporting a partial reopening strategy. One month of shelter-in-place restrictions provides QALY benefits from averted mortality that exceed the associated GDP costs relative to limited reopening if the restrictions prevent at least 154,586 additional COVID-19 deaths over the course of the pandemic. Current models of disease progression suggest that limited reopening will not cause this many additional deaths, again supporting a limited reopening strategy.

LimitationLimited horizon of COVID-19 mortality projections; infection fatality ratio stable across strategies, ignoring both the potential for ICU overload to increase mortality and the deployment of partially effective therapeutics to decrease mortality; effect on GDP modeled as constant within a given phase of the pandemic; accounts for age and sex distribution of QALYs, but not effect of comorbidities; only considers impact from QALY lost due to mortality and from changes in GDP, excluding numerous other considerations, such as non-fatal COVID-19 morbidity, reduced quality of life caused by prolonged social distancing, or educational regression associated with prolonged school closures and restrictions.

ConclusionsA limited reopening to achieve partial mitigation of COVID-19 is cost effective relative to a full reopening if an effective therapeutic or vaccine can be deployed within 11.1 months of late May 2020. One additional month of shelter-in-place restrictions should only be imposed if it saves at least 154,586 lives per month before the development of an effective therapeutic or vaccine relative to limited reopening.

51,10608,Mapping the Global Research and Clinical Trials in COVID-19,"COVID-19 has created an unprecedented level of research and innovation activity globally to bring out drug to control or cure the disease, and develop vaccine for long time prevention. A  new/better normal is emerging that is trying to push this time period for drug development and vaccine within a year and earlier than that from typical 8 to 10 years for drugs and 10 to 15 years for vaccine. This is happening due to multiple factors: strong policy push by different government that includes dedicated investment, speeding up regulation process, multiple agencies involvement, and multilateral bodies led by WHO trying to create a global platform, huge grants from private funding bodies, strategic linkages across the whole research and innovation value chain between firms, academic, research organisations and start-ups.

The paper maps the research papers and ongoing clinical trials to provide an informed view of the current status of the research and drug development activity as seen through the lens of research papers and clinical trials.

In the absence of any vaccine, various mitigation measures were used. In the past, the effect of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus was studied for a very early phase of the data with mixed results. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on the maximum temperature and relative humidity of a place using Indian states as test cases for SIR, SIRD, and SEIR models. We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and relative humidity. Most of the states showed a correlation with the negative slope between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and the relative humidity. It indicates that the effective reproduction number goes down as maximum temperature or relative humidity rise. But, the regression coefficient R2 was low for these correlations which means that the correlation is not strong.",06/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.05.20146324,Sabyasachi Pal,Midnapore City College,medrxiv,0,0
54,11415,'Trained immunity' from  Mycobacterium spp. exposure or BCG vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes,"Protective variables for COVID-19 are unknown.  Trained immunity of the populace as a result of BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of  trained immunity or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of controls for underlying  trained immunity and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.",02/09/2020,10.1101/2020.07.11.20151308,Samer Singh,Banaras Hindu University Institute of Medical Sciences,medrxiv,0,0
55,11879,"Qing Fei Pai Du Tang, a Chinese multi-herbal medicine formulated against COVID-19, elevates the plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and IL-8","There are currently no specific vaccine or drugs proven to be effective against COVID-19. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been integrated into the official therapeutic protocol against COVID-19 in China. Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT) is a Chinese multi-herbal formula newly developed and specifically optimized for the treatment of COVID-19. Therapeutic administration of QFPDT resulted in an improved cure rate in mild to critically-ill patients. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of QFPDT has been poorly understood. Furthermore, the feasibility of prophylactic use in uninfected individuals remain unconfirmed. We thus examined whether the administration of QFPDT at a dose lower than recommended for therapeutic use alters hematological and/or immunological measures in healthy individuals. We found that QFPDT elevates the plasma levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-18, TNF-, and IL-8, which are key mediators of acute inflammatory responses to ssRNA viruses. No apparent adverse effects were observed during the trial. Our finding suggests that the pharmacological action of QFPDT is associated with the upregulation of a subset of proinflammatory cytokines despite its clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients. We should therefore be careful in its prophylactic use in uninfected individuals until we have a better understanding of the immunopharmacological action of QFPDT through further clinical studies with larger cohorts.",20/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.13.20146175,Tsutomu Nakamura,"Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo",medrxiv,0,0

MethodsA cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate.

ResultsThe majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial willingness.

ConclusionsHigh standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.",14/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.13.20152678,Danhua Lin,Beijing Normal University,medrxiv,0,0
57,11663,Longitudinal dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF.

ConclusionsThese data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.",17/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159,Ai-Long Huang,Chongqing Medical University,medrxiv,0,0
58,11691,Reconciling model predictions with low reported cases of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights from Madagascar,"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally, and there has been a particular concern for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where models suggest that the majority of the population will become infected. Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers high burdens of other infectious diseases: ecology, socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems. However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading explanations, each with very different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case detection, (2) differences in COVID-19 epidemiology (e.g. low R0), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases to date have led some SSA governments to relax these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the current incidence of COVID-19 cases can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of an impending health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar until early 2021, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.

Il y a trois explications principales pour ce phenomene, chacune ayant des implications tres differentes pour le fardeau epidemique final: (1) detection faible des cas, (2) differences dans lepidemiologie COVID-19 (par exemple faible R0), et (3) interventions et politiques mises en place. Le faible nombre de cas a ce jour a conduit certains gouvernements dASS a assouplir ces interventions. Cela entrainera-t-il une resurgence de cas? Pour comprendre comment interpreter le fait que les cas COVID-19 rapportes sont plus faibles que prevu a Madagascar, nous utilisons un modele de transmission structure par groupe dage pour explorer chacune de ces explications et predire limpact epidemique qui leur est associe. Nous montrons que lincidence actuelle des cas de COVID-19 peut sexpliquer par leffet cumule de lintroduction tardive des premiers cas importes, la mise en uvre rapide dinterventions non pharmaceutiques (INP) et de faibles taux de detection des cas. Cette analyse renforce le fait que Madagascar, ainsi que dautres pays dAfrique subsaharienne, reste a risque dune crise sanitaire imminente. Si les INP restent appliques, jusqua 50 000 vies pourraient etre sauvees. Meme avec des INP, tant quil ny aura pas des vaccins ni des nouvelles therapies efficaces, COVID-19 pourrait infecter jusqua 30% de la population, ce qui constituerait la plus grande menace pour la sante publique a Madagascar jusquau debut de 2021, dou limportance de la realisation des essais cliniques et de lamelioration continuelle de lacces aux soins.

Summary BoxO_LIThe lower-than-expected number of reported cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar can be explained by a combination of the relatively late introduction of the disease, low detection rates, and low transmission rates due to the early and effective implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduced contact rates.
C_LIO_LICOVID-19 is predicted to be the largest public health problem in Madagascar in 2020, but non-pharmaceutical interventions at an effectiveness similar to those seen in the first few months could save up to 50,000 lives.
C_LIO_LIHealth systems in SSA remain at risk of an impending health crisis due to COVID-19, stressing the importance of ongoing clinical trials and improving health care access.

60,11937,Neutralizing and binding antibody kinetics of COVID-19 patients during hospital and convalescent phases,"Knowledge of the host immune response after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for informing directions of vaccination and epidemiological control strategies against COVID-19. In this study, thirty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled with 244 serial blood specimens (38.1% after hospital discharge) collected to explore the chronological evolution of neutralizing (NAb), total (TAb), IgM, IgG and IgA antibody in parallel. IgG titers reached a peak later (approximately 35 days postonset) than those of Nab, Ab, IgM and IgA (20[~]25 days postonset). After peaking, IgM levels declined with an estimated average half-life of 10.36 days, which was more rapid than those of IgA (51.25 days) and IgG (177.39 days). Based on these half-life data, we estimate that the median times for IgM, IgA and IgG to become seronegative are 4.59 (IQR 4.12-5.03), 7.78 (IQR 6.71-9.16) and 42.72 (IQR 33.75-47.96) months post disease onset. The relative contribution of IgM to NAb was higher than that of IgG (standardized {beta} regression coefficient: 0.53 vs 0.48), so the rapid decline in NAb may be attributed to the rapid decay of IgM in acute phase. However, the relative contribution of IgG to NAb increased and that of IgM further decreased after 6 weeks postonset. Its assumed that the decline rate of NAb might slow down to the same level as that of IgG over time. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust neutralizing and binding antibody responses in patients and that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 acquired by infection may persist for a relatively long time.",21/07/2020,10.1101/2020.07.18.20156810,Sheng-Xiang Ge,"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai",medrxiv,0,0
61,12274,"Viral RNA level, serum antibody responses, and transmission risk in discharged COVID-19 patients with recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results: a population-based observational cohort study","SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSManaging discharged COVID-19 (DC) patients with recurrent positive (RP) SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results is challenging. We aimed to comprehensively characterize the viral RNA level and serum antibody responses in RP-DC patients and evaluate their viral transmission risk.

MethodsA population-based observational cohort study was performed on 479 DC patients discharged from February 1 to May 5, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. We conducted RT-qPCR, antibody assays, neutralisation assays, virus isolation, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and epidemiological investigation of close contacts.

FindingsOf 479 DC patients, the 93 (19%) RP individuals, including 36 with multiple RP results, were characterised by young age (median age: 34 years, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-38 years). The median discharge-to-RP length was 8 days (95% CI: 7-14 days; maximum: 90 days). After readmission, RP-DC patients exhibited mild (28%) or absent (72%) symptoms, with no disease progression. The viral RNA level in RP-DC patients ranged from 1{middle dot}9-5{middle dot}7 log10 copies/mL (median: 3{middle dot}2, 95% CI: 3{middle dot}1-3{middle dot}5). At RP detection, the IgM, IgG, IgA, total antibody, and neutralising antibody (NAb) seropositivity rates in RP-DC patients were 38% (18/48), 98% (47/48), 63% (30/48), 100% (48/48), and 91% (39/43), respectively. Regarding antibody levels, there was no significant difference between RP-DC and non-RP-DC patients. The antibody level remained constant in RP-DC patients pre- and post-RP detection. Virus isolation of nine representative specimens returned negative results. WGS of six specimens yielded only genomic fragments. No clinical symptoms were exhibited by 96 close contacts of 23 RP-DC patients; their viral RNA (96/96) and antibody (20/20) test results were negative. After full recovery, 60% of patients (n=162, 78 no longer RP RP-DC and 84 non-RP-DC) had NAb titres of [&ge;]1:32.

InterpretationRP may occur in DC patients following intermittent and non-stable excretion of low viral RNA levels. RP-DC patients pose a low risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. An NAb titre of [&ge;] 1:32 may provide a reference indicator for evaluating humoral responses in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.

62,12122,D614G Spike Mutation Increases SARS CoV-2 Susceptibility to Neutralization.,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the COVID-19 pandemic that appears to confer on the virus greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form of the virus. Certain of the current vaccines entering phase 3 trials are based on the original D614 form of Spike with the goal of eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies. To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against the receptor binding domain and by convalescent sera from people known to be infected with either the D614 or G614 form of the virus. These results indicate that a gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies, and that the mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development.",12/09/2020,10.1101/2020.07.22.20159905,Drew Weissman,University of Pennsylvania,medrxiv,0,0
63,12366,A Retrospective Study on Efficacy and Safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati for Covid-19 Asymptomatic Patients,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been declared global emergency with immediate safety, preventative and curative measures to control the spread of virus. Confirmed cases are treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19. Ayurveda has been recommended by preventative and clinical management guidelines in India and several clinical trials are ongoing. But there is no study to assess impact of Ayurveda on Covid-19.

MethodsObjective of present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in Covid-19 confirmed asymptomatic to mild symptomatic patients who had received Ayurveda and compare with control (who has not received Ayurveda or any support therapy). Patients having Ayurveda intervention (Guduchi Ghan Vati-extract of Tinospora cordifolia) were included from Jodhpur Covid Care Centre and non-recipients were taken from Jaipur Covid Care Centre between May 15 to June 15, 2020. Total 91 patients, who were asymptomatic at the time of hospital admission and between 18 -75 years of age, were included in the study to analyse retrospectively.

ResultsIn control group, 11.7% developed mild symptoms after average 1.8 days and none in Ayurveda group reported any symptoms. Significant difference was reported between the group of patients taking Guduchi Ghan Vati (n=40) and patients in standard care (n=51) in terms of virologic clearance at day-7 (97.5% vs 15.6% respectively; p=0.000), at day 14 (100% vs 82.3%) days to stay in hospital (6.4 vs 12.8 respectively; p< 0.0001).

ConclusionResults of the study suggest that Guduchi Ghan Vati, a common and widely used Ayurveda preparation, could benefit treating asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Larger, randomised controlled Trials are required to confirm the findings.

64,12521,Impact of reduction of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 on epidemic dynamics in four early-seeded metropolitan regions,"The coronavirus pandemic is wreaking public health, social, and economic havoc across the globe, and to date a variety of strategies have been implemented to attempt to control the spread of disease [1, 2]. A critical unknown for policy planning is the number of people who have been infected and are no longer susceptible [3]. Tests for active SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibody presence can provide an indication, but both are prone to selection bias, under-representative population sampling and insufficient reliability [4, 5]. Here, we present an alternative to determine residual susceptibilities based on the analysis of observed population-wide disease dynamics data. For four highly-affected countries, we directly compared the dynamics in the largest metropolitan regions with the rest of the countries. We show that substantial susceptibility reductions are measurable in the metropolitan regions, which all continued in a phase of exponential growth of case numbers for a relatively longer time before public health interventions were introduced. Compared to these interventions, the reduction in metropolitan region susceptibility had a substantial role in the post-growth decline in infection rates. Reduced population susceptibility has far reaching consequences on future policy responses and disease forecasts including vaccine trial planning and, in the case of a second epidemic wave, higher population-normalised mortality rates for non-metropolitan regions.",19/09/2020,10.1101/2020.07.28.20163154,Peter Kruger,University of Sussex,medrxiv,0,0
66,12672,Safety and effectiveness of dose-sparing strategies for seasonal influenza vaccine: a rapid scoping review of fractional dosing of the intramuscular influenza vaccine,"BackgroundThe objective of this rapid scoping review was to identify potentially safe and effective dose-sparing strategies for intramuscular administration of seasonal influenza vaccines in healthy individuals of all ages.

MethodsComprehensive literature searches were developed and executed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library, and grey literature was searched via international clinical trial registries for relevant studies published in English in the last 20 years. References of relevant systematic reviews and included studies were also scanned. Title/abstract and full-text screening were carried out by pairs of reviewers independently and data charting conducted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Results were presented narratively.

ResultsA total of 13 studies with 10,351 participants were included in the review and all studies were randomized control trials conducted between 2006 and 2019. The most common interventions were the trivalent influenza vaccine (n=10), followed by quadrivalent influenza vaccine (n=4). Nine studies included infants/toddlers 6-36 months old and one of these studies also included children and adolescents. In these nine studies, no clinical effectiveness outcomes were reported and no difference was found in local and systemic reactogenicity between dosing strategies. Of the four adult studies ([&ge;] 18 years), the two studies that reported on effectiveness outcomes found similar results between the half-dose and full-dose vaccination groups and all four studies reported no differences in safety outcomes between groups.

ConclusionThe current evidence for the administration of intramuscular influenza vaccines suggests there is no significant difference in safety and clinical effectiveness with the use of low-dose compared to full-dose vaccines, which is promising given the predicted resource constraints in the upcoming influenza season due to the 2019 novel coronavirus. Due to the low number of studies in adults and the lack of studies assessing confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness, there remains a need for further evaluation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSPURPOSEC_ST_ABSThe Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) submitted a query regarding the safety and effectiveness of fractional dosing of seasonal influenza vaccines through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN). They requested that the DSEN Methods and Application Group in Indirect Comparisons (MAGIC) conduct a rapid review on this topic with an approximate 6-week timeline.

The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify potentially safe and effective dose-sparing strategies for administration of seasonal influenza vaccines in healthy individuals of all ages that have been evaluated in human trials. In order to limit the scope of the work and ensure the rapid timeline could be met, this review focused only on intramuscular vaccine formulations, thus the research question was as follows:

67,12675,"Evaluation of Convalescent Plasma versus Standard of Care for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalazed Patients: study protocol for a phase 2 randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter trial","BackgroundCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods/DesignThe ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The protocol has been prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to categories 5, 6 or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment.

DiscussionThis clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease.

69,13027,Public perceptions and preventive behaviours during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparative study between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom,"BackgroundIn the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of COVID-19 relies on population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions, which is driven by their risk perception, anxiety level and knowledge. There may also be regional discrepancies in these drivers due to different historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. As such, this study compared psycho-behavioral responses in two regions during the early phase of the pandemic.

MethodsComparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of each respective epidemic. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including interaction terms to quantify regional differences, were used to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing measures.

ResultsData of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity differed by region (HK: 97.5%; UK: 20.7%). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally/borderline anxious (HK:64.8%; UK:45.9%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.4-93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by region. In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as ""high"" were more likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as ""easy"" were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary by region.

DiscussionThese results suggest that health officials should ascertain and consider baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be done through suitable media channels - and trust should be maintained - while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.",07/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.06.20169409,Kin On Kwok,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,medrxiv,0,0
70,13112,Considering indirect benefits is critical when evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates,"Significant progress has already been made in development and testing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and Phase III clinical trials have begun for 6 novel vaccine candidates to date. These Phase III trials seek to demonstrate direct benefits of a vaccine on vaccine recipients. However, vaccination is also known to bring about indirect benefits to a population through the reduction of virus circulation. The indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can play a key role in reducing case counts and COVID-19 deaths. To illustrate this point, we show through simulation that a vaccine with strong indirect effects has the potential to reduce SARS-CoV-2 circulation and COVID-19 deaths to a greater extent than an alternative vaccine with stronger direct effects but weaker indirect effects. Protection via indirect effects may be of particular importance in the context of this virus, because elderly individuals are at an elevated risk of death but are also less likely to be directly protected by vaccination due to immune senescence. We therefore encourage ongoing data collection and model development aimed at evaluating the indirect effects of forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",11/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.07.20170456,Molly E.

71,13335,Local protection bubbles: an interpretation of the decrease in the velocity of coronavirus's spread in the city of Sao Paulo,"After four months of dealing with the pandemic, the city of Sao Paulo entered a phase of relaxed social-distancing measures in July 2020, and saw its social isolation rate fall at the same time as the number of cases, deaths, and hospital bed occupation declined. We use a calibrated multi-agent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the citys sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the viruss spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the viruss spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the populations transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.",14/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.11.20173039,Jose Paulo Guedes Pinto,Federal University of ABC (UFABC),medrxiv,0,0
73,13751,Dynamic causal modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern Italy predicts possible scenarios for the second wave,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an intense debate about the factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak. Mitigating virus spread could benefit from reliable predictive models that inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection that underwrite ongoing social and healthcare strategies. Formally, the problem at hand is not unlike the one faced in neuroscience when modelling brain dynamics in terms of the activity of a neural network: the recent COVID-19 pandemic develops in epicenters (e.g. cities or regions) and diffuses through transmission channels (e.g., population fluxes). Indeed, the analytic framework known as ""Dynamic Causal Modeling"" (DCM) has recently been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the mechanisms and latent factors driving its evolution. The DCM approach rests on a time-series generative model that provides -- through Bayesian model inversion and inference -- estimates of the factors underlying the progression of the pandemic. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, which were the first areas in Europe to contend with the COVID-19 outbreak. We used official data on the number of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and performed tests. The model -- parameterized using data from the first months of the pandemic phase -- was able to accurately predict its subsequent evolution (including social mobility, as assessed through GPS monitoring, and seroprevalence, as assessed through serologic testing) and revealed the potential factors underlying regional heterogeneity. Importantly, the model predicts that a second wave could arise due to a loss of effective immunity after about 7 months. This second wave was predicted to be substantially worse if outbreaks are not promptly isolated and contained. In short, dynamic causal modelling appears to be a reliable tool to shape and predict the spread of the COVID-19, and to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently counteract its second wave, until effective vaccines become available.",23/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.20.20178798,Daniela Gandolfi,University of Modena and Reggio Emilia,medrxiv,0,0
74,13758,Poor knowledge of COVID-19 and unfavourable perception of the response to the pandemic by healthcare workers at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (West Region - Cameroon),"BackgroundThe World Health Organization has warned against a dramatic impact of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa unless adequate response strategies are implemented. Whatever the strategy, the role of health care workers is pivotal. We undertook this study to assess knowledge of COVID-19 and perception of the response to the pandemic among the staff of a regional hospital in charge of COVID-19 patients in West Cameroon.

MethodsWe used a convenience non probabilistic sampling method to carry out a survey with a self-administered questionnaire from April 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020 at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (BRH). All the staff was invited to participate. Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Epi-lnfo version 7.1.5.2 software.

ResultsResponse rate was 76.1% (464/610). Mean age (SD) and average work experience (SD) were 35.0 (8.9) and 8.4 (7.4) years respectively. Sex ratio (M/F) was 101/356. Nursing and midwifery staff (56.8%) and in-patients units (49.94%) were predominant. Knowledge on origin and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was poor but knowledge of clinical signs and the role of laboratory tests were good. 53.2% of respondents said all therapeutic regimens are only supportive and only a third of them trusted drugs recommended by health authorities. For 36.9% of respondents, herbal remedies can prevent/cure COVID-19. 70% of staffs felt they were not knowledgeable enough to handle COVID-19 cases. 85.6% of respondents thought the BRH had insufficient resources to adequately respond to COVID-19 and 55.6% were dissatisfied with its response to the pandemic (weaknesses: medicines/technologies (74.5%), service delivery (28.1%), human resource (10.9%)). 68% of staff felt insufficiently protected on duty and 76.5% reported that the pandemic significantly reduced non-COVID-19 services. 85.5% said they complied with preventive measures while in the community. For 44% of respondents Cameroonian regulations on COVID-19 corpses should be made more culture-sensitive. 51.2% of respondents were against vaccine trial in their community.

75,13954,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans: a systematic review,"IntroductionProgress in characterising the humoral immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapid but areas of uncertainty persist. This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020.

MethodsSystematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised.

Results150 papers were included. Most studies (75%) were observational in design, and included papers were generally of moderate quality based on hospitalised patients. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, and up to around 3 months from disease onset, although inconsistencies remain concerning clinical correlates. Development of neutralising antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is typical, although titres may be low. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross reactivity but limited cross neutralisation occurs with other HCoVs. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo is limited to small, short-term animal studies, which show promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase.

InterpretationPublished literature on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity with regard to methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Antibody dynamics have been evaluated thoroughly in the acute phase but longer follow up and a comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity is needed. The role of protective neutralising antibodies is emerging, with implications for therapeutics and vaccines. Large, cross-national cohort studies using appropriate statistical analysis and standardised serological assays and clinical classifications should be prioritised.",30/08/2020,10.1101/2020.08.25.20178806,Danielle Eddy,Public Health England,medrxiv,0,0
76,14150,Systematic examination of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 versus influenza virus reveals distinct inflammatory profile,"There is a pressing need for an in-depth understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated T cell recall responses to fully glycosylated Spike trimer, recombinant N protein as well as to S, N, M and E peptide pools in the early convalescent phase. All subjects showed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses to at least one antigen. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were primarily of the central memory phenotype and exhibited a lower IFN-{gamma} to TNF- ratio compared to influenza-specific responses of the same donors, independent of disease severity. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were less multifunctional than influenza-specific T cells, particularly in severe cases, potentially suggesting exhaustion. High IL-10 production was noted in response to N protein, possibly contributing to immunosuppression, with potential implications for vaccine design. We observed granzyme B+/IFN-{gamma}g+ CD4+ and CD8+ proliferative responses to peptide pools in most individuals, with CD4+ responses predominating over CD8+ responses. Peripheral T follicular helper responses to S or N strongly correlated with serum neutralization assays as well as RBD-specific IgA. Overall, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are robust, however, CD4+ Th1 responses predominate over CD8+ responses and are more inflammatory with a weaker Tfh response than influenza-specific CD4+ responses, potentially contributing to COVID-19 disease.",01/09/2020,10.1101/2020.08.27.20183319,Tania H Watts,University of Toronto,medrxiv,0,0

78,14513,Immunological characteristics govern the changing severity of COVID-19 during the transition to endemicity,"1As prospects for eradicating CoV-2 dwindle, we are faced with the question of how the severity of CoV-2 disease may change in the years ahead. Will CoV-2 continue to be a pathogenic scourge that, like smallpox or measles, can be tamed only by ongoing vaccination, or will it join the ranks of mild endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)? Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on HCoVs shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. We estimate the relevant parameters and incorporate them into a new epidemiological model framework which separates these different components of immunity. Our model recapitulates both the current severity of CoV-2 and the relatively benign nature of HCoVs; suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached, CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. The benign outcome at the endemic phase is contingent on the virus causing primary infections in children. We predict a very different outcome were a CoV like MERS (that causes severe disease in children) to become endemic. These results force us to re-evaluate control measures that rely on identifying and isolating symptomatic infections, and reconsider ideas regarding herd immunity and the use of immune individuals as shields to protect vulnerable groups.",05/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.03.20187856,Jennie S Lavine,Emory University,medrxiv,0,0
79,14696,Demographic Differences in US Adult Intentions to Receive a Potential Coronavirus Vaccine and Implications for Ongoing Study,"BackgroundThe coronavirus pandemics public health and economic impacts have led to much hope in the US regarding the prospect of a safe, effective vaccine to either prevent infection or minimize symptoms and reduce mortality risk. However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it.

Methods and findingsMultivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n = 1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.",09/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.07.20190058,Richard M.

80,15003,Characterization and Phase 1 Trial of a B Cell Activating Anti-CD73 Antibody for the Immunotherapy of COVID-19,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in over 800,000 deaths. Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. This approach may be useful for treating COVID-19 or as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.",15/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.10.20191486,Stephen B Willingham,Corvus Pharmaceuticals,medrxiv,0,0

Furthermore, sex differences characterize the frequency and severity of pharmacological side effects. A large number of clinical trials are ongoing to develop new therapeutic approaches and vaccines for COVID-19. We investigated the inclusion of sex and/or gender in currently registered studies on ClinicalTrials.gov. Only 416 (16.7%) of the 2,484 registered SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 trials mention sex/gender as recruitment criterion and only 103 (4.1%) allude to sex/gender in the description of the analysis phase. None of the 11 clinical trials published in scientific journals on June 2020 reported sex-disaggregated results. Hence, lack of consideration upon registration does not seem to be corrected during trial execution and reporting. Given the biological relevance and the potential risks of unwanted side effects, we urge researchers to focus on sex-disaggregated analyses already at the planning stage of COVID-19 trials.",14/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.13.20193680,Sabine Oertelt-Prigione,Radboud University Medical Center,medrxiv,0,0

Using epidemiological models calibrated to the current pandemic, we simulate the time course of each clinical trial design for 504 unique combinations of parameters, allowing us to determine which trial design is most effective for a given scenario. A human challenge trial provides maximal net benefits--averting an additional 1.1M infections and 8,000 deaths in the U.S. compared to the next best clinical trial design--if its set-up time is short or the pandemic spreads slowly.

83,15228,How the clinical research community responded to the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of the COVID-19 clinical studies in ClinicalTrials.gov,"ObjectiveThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, is a global pandemic. Rapidly in the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies. In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the gaps and issues that may cause difficulty in recruitment and the lack of population representativeness.

Materials and MethodsWe analyzed 2,034 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov. Leveraging natural language processing, descriptive analysis, association analysis, and clustering analysis, we characterized COVID-19 clinical studies by phase and design features. Particularly, we analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand: (1) whether they considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) if these studies excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies in older adults.

ResultsThe 5 most frequently tested drugs are Hydroxychloroquine (N=148), Azithromycin (N=46), Tocilizumab (N=29), Lopinavir (N=20), and Ritonavir (N=20). Most trials did not have an upper age limit and did not exclude patients with common chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes that are prevalent in older adults. However, known risk factors that may lead to severe illnesses have not been adequately considered by existing studies.

ConclusionsA careful examination of the registered COVID-19 clinical studies can identify the research gaps and inform future COVID-19 trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability.",15/12/2020,10.1101/2020.09.16.20195552,Zhe He,Florida State University,medrxiv,0,0
84,15242,Suppression of COVID-19 infection by isolation time control based on the SIR model and an analogy from nuclear fusion research,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been damaging our daily life after declaration of pandemic. Therefore, we have started studying on the characteristics of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to know about the truth of infectious disease and our future.

After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term (isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the ""helium ash particle loss term"" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation control time parameter q and have studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this proposed method.

To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density. We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3[~]8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer. We consider this isolation time control might be the only solution to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.",23/11/2020,10.1101/2020.09.18.20197723,Osamu Mitarai,Institute for Advanced Fusion & Physics Education,medrxiv,0,0
85,15434,Molecular Architecture of Early Dissemination and Massive Second Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in a Major Metropolitan Area,"We sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains causing two COVID-19 disease waves in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston, and an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotypes and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some regions of the spike protein - the primary target of global vaccine efforts - are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR30022. Our study is the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region. The findings will help us to understand the origin, composition, and trajectory of future infection waves, and the potential effect of the host immune response and therapeutic maneuvers on SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

IMPORTANCEThere is concern about second and subsequent waves of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus occurring in communities globally that had an initial disease wave. Metropolitan Houston, Texas, with a population of 7 million, is experiencing a massive second disease wave that began in late May 2020. To understand SARS-CoV-2 molecular population genomic architecture, evolution, and relationship between virus genotypes and patient features, we sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains from these two waves. Our study provides the first molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 strains causing two distinct COVID-19 disease waves.",29/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.22.20199125,James Musser,Houston Methodist Hospital,medrxiv,0,0
87,15564,"When it is available, will we take it? Public perception of hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria","COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health threat facing mankind. There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. This study aims to understand the perception of the public towards hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in August 2020 across the 36 states of Nigeria using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. The results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.87%). Most of the respondents (385, 74.47%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance is unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.12%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.27%). There are significant association with the respondents age and having reservations toward vaccination [{chi}2= 19.0389 P-value=0.00] and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance [{chi}2=24.3316 P-value=0.00]. Furthermore, geographical location and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine [{chi}2=13.7786 P-value=0.02] are significantly associated.

88,15517,The potential health and economic value of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alongside physical distancing in the UK: transmission model-based future scenario analysis and economic evaluation,"BackgroundIn response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the UK adopted mandatory physical distancing measures in March 2020. Vaccines against the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may become available as early as late 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing scenarios in the UK.

MethodsWe used an age-structured dynamic-transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of immunisation programmes over ten years. Assuming vaccines are effective in 5-64 year olds, we compared vaccinating 90% of individuals in this age group to no vaccination. We assumed either vaccine effectiveness of 25% and 1-year protection and 90% re-vaccinated annually, or 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection and 10% re-vaccinated annually. Natural immunity was assumed to last 45 weeks in the base case. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing. We considered benefits from disease prevented in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs to the healthcare payer versus the national economy. We discounted at 3.5% annually and monetised health impact at {pound}20,000 per QALY to obtain the net monetary value, which we explored in sensitivity analyses.

FindingsWithout vaccination and physical distancing, we estimated 147.9 million COVID-19 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 48.5 million, 198.7 million) and 2.8 million (770,000, 4.2 million) deaths in the UK over ten years. Vaccination with 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection may stop community transmission entirely for several years, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic without highly effective vaccines. Introducing vaccination compared to no vaccination leads to economic gains (positive net monetary value) of {pound}0.37 billion to +{pound}1.33 billion across all physical distancing and vaccine effectiveness scenarios from the healthcare perspective, but net monetary values of physical distancing scenarios may be negative from societal perspective if the daily national economy losses are persistent and large.

InterpretationOur model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Given uncertainty around both characteristics of the eventually licensed vaccines and long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, our study provides early insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and medRxiv for economic evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with the search string (coronavirus OR COVID OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (vaccin* OR immunisation) AND ((economic evaluation) OR (cost effectiveness analysis)) AND 2020[dp] on September 21, 2020, with no language restrictions. We found one pre-print that valued health outcomes in monetary terms and explored the additional impact of vaccines in a cost-benefit analysis of physical distancing for the USA; no study focused on vaccines in a full economic evaluation.

Added value of this studyWith a growing number of vaccine candidates under development and having entered clinical trials, our study is to our knowledge the first to explore the health and economic value of introducing a national SARS-CoV-2 immunisation programme. A programme with high vaccine effectiveness and long-lasting protection may stop the community transmission entirely for a couple of years, but even a vaccine with 25% vaccine effectiveness is worthwhile to use; even at short-lived natural and vaccine-induced protections. After an initial lockdown, voluntary physical distancing as a sole strategy risks a large second epidemic peak, unless accompanied by highly effective immunisation. Compared to no vaccination, introducing vaccination leads to positive net monetary value across physical distancing scenarios from the healthcare perspective, subject to the long-run vaccine price and cost-effectiveness of other treatments (e.g. new drugs). The net monetary value of immunisation decreases if vaccine introduction is delayed, natural immunity is long or vaccine-induced protection is short. Intermittent physical distancing leads to negative net benefits from the perspective of the wider economy if the daily national income losses are persistent and large.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur model findings highlight the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Despite the many uncertainties, continued physical distancing may be needed to reduce community transmission until vaccines with sufficiently high vaccine effectiveness and long-lasting protection are available. Our study provides first broad health-economic insights rather than precise quantitative projections given the many uncertainties and unknown characteristics of the vaccine candidates and aspects of the long-term COVID-19 epidemiology, and the value of vaccines will ultimately depend on other socioeconomic and health-related policies and population behaviours.",25/09/2020,10.1101/2020.09.24.20200857,Frank Sandmann,PHE/LSHTM,medrxiv,0,0
90,15883,"Quantifying the dynamics of COVID-19 burden and impact of interventions in Java, Indonesia","BackgroundAs in many countries, quantifying COVID-19 spread in Indonesia remains challenging due to testing limitations. In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island.

MethodsWe used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine roll-out.

ResultsC19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled-out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign.

ConclusionSyndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.

Key questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIIn many settings, limited SARS-CoV-2 testing makes it difficult to estimate the true trajectory and associated burden of the virus.
C_LIO_LINon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are key tools to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
C_LIO_LIVaccines show promise but effectiveness depends upon prioritization strategies, roll-out and uptake.

What are the new findings?O_LIThis study gives evidence of the value of syndrome-based mortality as a metric, which is less dependent upon testing capacity with which to estimate transmission trends and evaluate intervention impact.
C_LIO_LINPIs implemented in Java earlier in the pandemic have substantially slowed the course of the epidemic with movement restrictions during Ramadan preventing spread to more vulnerable rural populations.
C_LIO_LIPopulation-level immunity remains below proposed herd-immunity thresholds for the virus, though it is likely substantially higher in Jakarta.
C_LI

What do the new findings imply?O_LIGiven current levels of control, upwards trends in deaths are likely to continue in many provinces while the vaccine is scheduled to be rolled out. A key exception is Jakarta where population-level immunity may increase to a level where the epidemic begins to decline before the vaccine campaign has reached high coverage.
C_LIO_LIFurther relaxation of measures would lead to more rapidly progressing epidemics, depleting the eventual incremental effectiveness of the vaccine. Maintaining adherence to control measures in Jakarta may be particularly challenging if the epidemic enters a decline phase but will remain necessary to prevent a subsequent large wave. Elsewhere, higher levels of control with NPIs are likely to yield high synergistic vaccine impact.

91,15956,Evaluating the Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines,"A large number of studies are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines against novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Most Phase 3 trials have adopted virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease as the primary efficacy endpoint, although laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest. In addition, it is important to evaluate the effect of vaccination on disease severity. To provide a full picture of vaccine efficacy and make efficient use of available data, we propose using SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 as dual or triple primary endpoints. We demonstrate the advantages of this strategy through realistic simulation studies. Finally, we show how this approach can provide rigorous interim monitoring of the trials and efficient assessment of the durability of vaccine efficacy.

SummaryTo increase statistical power and meet vaccine success criteria, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines by using the dual or triple primary endpoints of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe COVID-19.",10/12/2020,10.1101/2020.10.02.20205906,Dan-Yu Lin,"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",medrxiv,0,0
92,15961,Safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy used for the management of COVID 19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, which is highly contagious and a threat to human health, spreading across nearly 235 countries, affecting 33.8 million and causing 1.01 million fatalities as of 22 September 2020. Researchers have invested tremendous efforts to develop vaccines or effective drug therapy but have not yet been fruitful. Hence, we planned to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to supplement the readers with comprehensive data and credible information on the safety and efficacyof essential pharmacotherapy during the pharmacological management of COVID-19.

MethodsTheprotocol will be designed based on the updated PRISMA-P 2015 guidelines. An elaborate search of electronic databases such as PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, Medrxiv and other potential databases for articles published during January 2020 to 10 October 2020 is planned to be conducted. Following this,randomized control trials published in English language that assess the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy versusplacebo or standard of care or usual care will be evaluated for inclusion. The primary outcomes will include time to clinical recovery and the probability for the negative conversion of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes will quantifythe proportion of patients relieved of symptoms, the all-cause mortality, morbidity, detection of viral RNA, time needed to achieve a negative viral load, ordinal scale changes, ventilatorand oxygen requirements,length of hospital stayand the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events.RevMan V.5.3 computer software packages will be utilised to conduct an accurate statistical analysis of the study. Thebinary random-effects model will be used at a 95 % confidence interval to estimate the weighted effect size ofdichotomous data and continuous data studies. The results of statistical analysis will be considered statistically significant whena p-value <0.05 is attained.

ResultsSelected studies will be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy used during the management of the novel COVID-19.

ConclusionThis study will be a qualitative and quantitative pool of comprehensive evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy on COVID-19.

93,15985,An open-label prospective observational study of antiandrogen and non-antiandrogen early pharmacological approaches in females with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The Pre-AndroCoV Female Trial.,"BackgroundWhile COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.

Materials and methodsFemales with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression.

ResultsIn total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 {+/-} 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 {+/-} 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 {+/-} 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), headache (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), dry cough (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), myalgia (1.2 {+/-} 0.4), nauseas (1.3 {+/-} 0.5) and weakness (1.3 {+/-} 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication.

ConclusionsA sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.",06/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.05.20206870,Flavio A Cadegiani,Federal University of Sao Paulo,medrxiv,0,0
94,16188,A high-throughput microfluidic nano-immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or ultra-low volume dried blood samples,"Novel technologies are needed to facilitate large-scale detection and quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies in human blood samples. Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 {micro}L whole blood easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.",08/02/2021,10.1101/2020.10.07.20208280,Sebastian J.

95,16246,SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells correlate with neutralizing antibodies and increase during convalescence.,"T-cell immunity is likely to play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 by helping generate neutralizing antibodies. We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 21 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mount at least one CD4 T-cell response, and 48% of individuals mount detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh, defined as CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that M and N protein-specific pTfh may also assist in the development of neutralizing antibodies and that pTfh response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Author SummarySince December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most currently licensed vaccines are understood to protect against infection by inducing neutralizing antibodies. As such, ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials have focused on antibody neutralization as a primary immunologic endpoint. It is well established that T follicular helper cells are essential to the development of neutralizing antibodies and that a subset of these cells, peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh), can be studied in the blood. However, little is known about Tfh responses mounted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we studied pTfh to three major structural proteins in individuals recovered from COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh frequencies correlate with neutralizing antibody responses, especially those directed against the spike protein. We also find that pTfh responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase over time. Our findings suggest that pTfh responses against proteins other than the spike protein may contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies and suggests that formation of pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be delayed.",12/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.07.20208488,Paul A.

96,16401,Symptoms and symptom clusters associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based populations: Results from a statewide epidemiological study,"BackgroundPrior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods.

MethodsWe pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsAmong 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection.

ConclusionsSymptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUsing multiple journal articles queried from MEDLINE as well as a Cochrane systematic review, we examined all studies that described symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19. We further examined the guidelines from WHO and CDC on the symptoms those public health authorities consider to be associated with COVID-19. Most of the evidence comes from China, Italy, and the United States. Collectively prior research and guidance suggests there are a dozen symptoms reported by individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in multiple countries. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The evidence is generally of low quality as it is descriptive in nature, and it is biased towards hospitalized patients. Most studies report the proportion of patients hospitalized or testing positive for infection who report one or more symptoms within 3-14 days prior to hospitalization or infection. There has been little validation of symptoms among hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. Furthermore, according to a Cochrane review, no studies to date assess combinations of different signs and symptoms.

Added value of this studyThis study employs multiple, rigorous methods to examine the ability of specific symptoms as well as symptom combinations/groups to predict laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the study is unique in its large sample drawn exclusively from community-based populations rather than hospitalized patients.

Implication of all the available evidenceCombining the evidence from this study with prior research suggests that anosmia and ageusia are key symptoms that differentiate COVID-19 from influenza-like symptoms. Clinical screening protocols for COVID-19 should look for these symptoms, which are not commonly asked of patients who present to urgent care or hospital with flu-like symptoms.

Key pointsImportant symptoms specific to COVID-19 are fever, anosmia, ageusia, and cough. Two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), yet most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. This study confirms using robust methods the key symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and it also identifies combinations of symptoms strongly associated with positive infection",22/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.11.20210922,Brian E Dixon,"Department of Epidemiology, IU Fairbanks School of Public Health",medrxiv,0,0
97,17216,Projected COVID-19 epidemic in the United States in the context of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine and implications for social distancing and face mask use,"BackgroundMultiple candidates of COVID-19 vaccines have entered Phase III clinical trials in the United States (US). There is growing optimism that social distancing restrictions and face mask requirements could be eased with widespread vaccine adoption soon.

MethodsWe developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission for the four most severely affected states (New York, Texas, Florida, and California). We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness and coverage required to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic in scenarios when social contact was to return to pre-pandemic levels and face mask use was reduced. Daily and cumulative COVID-19 infection and death cases were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus resource center and used for model calibration.

ResultsWithout a vaccine, the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed in these states by maintaining strict social distancing measures and face mask use levels. But relaxing social distancing restrictions to the pre-pandemic level without changing the current face mask use would lead to a new COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in 0.8-4 million infections and 15,000-240,000 deaths across these four states over the next 12 months. In this scenario, introducing a vaccine would partially offset this negative impact even if the vaccine effectiveness and coverage are relatively low. However, if face mask use is reduced by 50%, a vaccine that is only 50% effective (weak vaccine) would require coverage of 55-94% to suppress the epidemic in these states. A vaccine that is 80% effective (moderate vaccine) would only require 32-57% coverage to suppress the epidemic. In contrast, if face mask usage stops completely, a weak vaccine would not suppress the epidemic, and further major outbreaks would occur. A moderate vaccine with coverage of 48-78% or a strong vaccine (100% effective) with coverage of 33-58% would be required to suppress the epidemic. Delaying vaccination rollout for 1-2 months would not substantially alter the epidemic trend if the current interventions are maintained.

ConclusionsThe degree to which the US population can relax social distancing restrictions and face mask use will depend greatly on the effectiveness and coverage of a potential COVID-19 vaccine if future epidemics are to be prevented. Only a highly effective vaccine will enable the US population to return to life as it was before the pandemic.",30/10/2020,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221234,Lei Zhang,Xi\'an Jiaotong University,medrxiv,0,0
98,17306,Phase II Clinical trial for Evaluation of BCG as potential therapy for COVID-19,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is widely used in national vaccination programs worldwide. It is accepted that BCG alleviates both pathogen and allergy induced respiratory diseases that could also include Covid-19. To investigate this possibility, we randomly assigned 60 Covid-19 patients, after admission to the hospital with pneumonia and requirement for oxygen therapy in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single adult dose of intradermal BCG or normal saline with concomitant standard of care (SoC) medications. Primary endpoints were favorable prognosis of Covid-19 as deduced from resolution of pneumonia, viremia and secondary outcome were enumeration of ICU admissions, duration thereof and mortalities.

ResultsBoth primary and secondary endpoints were significantly improved in the BCG+SoC group. This could be seen from reduction in oxygen requirement due to Covid-19 associated pneumonia decreasing from day 3-4, improved radiological resolution from day 7-15. There were a total of 6 (10%) adverse events in the study of which 2 deaths and 4 ICU admissions were in SoC group (1 ICU admission culminated in death of the subject) and in contrast only 1 ICU admission in the BCG+SoC group. While there was an increase in Covid-19 specific IgG levels in the BCG+SoC group, there was no evidence of BCG induced cytokine storm in this group. Four patients showed localized inflammatory response at the injection site in the BCG+SoC group.

ConclusionsBCG+SoC administration resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with favorable outcomes than did SoC. A third of the patients were naive for childhood BCG vaccination. This mimicked elderly patients in countries with no universal vaccination policy for BCG. No BCG related adversity was seen in this group. The study shows that BCG is a safe, cost-effective treatment that can be introduced as a standard of care in patients with moderate Covid-19 that can reduce requirement of oxygen supplemented beds and disease burden in low resource countries, with additional long-term benefits of reducing risk for tuberculosis.",03/11/2020,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221630,Usha Padmanabhan,"Haffkine Institute for Training, Research & Testing",medrxiv,0,0
99,17376,How well does societal mobility restriction help control the COVID-19 pandemic? Evidence from real-time evaluation,"ObjectivesTo determine the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing transmission of COVID-19.

DesignDaily incidence rates lagged by 14 days were regressed on mobility changes using LOESS regression and logit regression between the day of the 100th case in each country to August 31, 2020.

Setting34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan.

ParticipantsGoogle mobility data were obtained from people who turned on mobile device-based global positioning system (GPS) and agreed to share their anonymized position information with Google.

InterventionsWe examined the association of COVID-19 incidence rates with mobility changes, defined as changes in categories of domestic location, against a pre-pandemic baseline, using country-specific daily incidence data on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and mobility data.

ResultsIn two thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. However, these decreases plateaued as mobility remained low or decreased further. We found smaller or negligible associations between mobility restriction and incidence rates in the late phase in most countries.

ConclusionMild to moderate degrees of mobility restriction in most countries were associated with reduced incidence rates of COVID-19 that appear to attenuate over time, while some countries exhibited no effect of such restrictions. More detailed research is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICSince SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic, restrictions on mobility such as limitations on travel and closure of offices, restaurants, and shops have been imposed in an unprecedented way in both scale and scope to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the absence of effective treatment options or a vaccine. Although mobility restriction has also brought about tremendous costs such as negative economic growth and other collateral impacts on health such as increased morbidity and mortality from lack of access to other essential health services, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of mobility restriction for the prevention of disease transmission. A search of PUBMED and Google Scholar for publications on this topic through Sep 20, 2020 revealed that most of the evidence on the effectiveness of physical distancing comes from mathematical modeling studies using a variety of assumptions. One study investigated only the combined effect of several interventions, including physical distancing, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSThis is the first study to investigate the association between change in mobility and incidence of COVID-19 globally using real-time measures of mobility at the population level. For this, we used Google Global Mobility data and the daily incidence of COVID-19 for 36 countries from the day of 100th case detection through August 31, 2020. Our findings from LOESS regression show that in two-thirds of countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. This decrease, however, plateaued as mobility decreased further. We found that associations between mobility restriction and incidence became smaller or negligible in the late phase of the pandemic in most countries. The reduced incidence rate of COVID-19 cases with a mild to moderate degree of mobility restriction in most countries suggests some value to limited mobility restriction in early phases of epidemic mitigation. The lack of impact in some others, however, suggests further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the distinguishing factors for when mobility restrictions are helpful in decreasing viral transmission. Governments should carefully consider the level and period of mobility restriction necessary to achieve the desired benefits and minimize harm.",03/11/2020,10.1101/2020.10.29.20222414,Hwa-Young Lee,"1.

100,17381,"Rapid, simplified whole blood-based multiparameter assay to quantify and phenotype SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells","Rapid tests to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are urgently needed to decipher protective immunity and aid monitoring vaccine-induced immunity. Using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal amount of blood, we measured qualitatively and quantitatively SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell responses in 31 healthcare workers, using flow cytometry. 100% of COVID-19 convalescent participants displayed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response. SARS-CoV-2-responding cells were also detected in 40.9% of participants with no COVID-19-associated symptoms or who tested PCR negative. Phenotypic assessment indicated that, in COVID-19 convalescent participants, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses displayed an early differentiated memory phenotype with limited capacity to produce IFN{gamma}. Conversely, in participants with no reported symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses were enriched in late differentiated cells, co-expressing IFN{gamma} and TNF and also Granzyme B. This proof of concept study presents a scalable alternative to PBMC-based assays to enumerate and phenotype SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells, thus representing a practical tool to monitor adaptive immunity in vaccine trials.

SummaryIn this proof of concept study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses are easily detectable using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal blood volume.

102,17444,Rapid homogeneous assay for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are needed for management of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and will help to examine possible vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal generation.

We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against S and N and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described S construct and a novel N construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S and N. We then compared the LFRET assays with these enzyme immunoassays and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT).

We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%).

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-minute  mix and read assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",04/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.01.20224113,Juuso Rusanen,University of Helsinki,medrxiv,0,0

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and medRxiv databases were used to select the studies. 7094 articles were identified initially and 43 were retrieved for more detailed evaluation. 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were selected. A total of 1604 subjects with either vaccines or placebo infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, there is an increase in total adverse events for subjects with either low (95% CI: 1.90-4.29) or high (CI: 2.65-5.63) dose vaccination. The adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccine are mainly local ones including pain, itching, and redness, and no significant difference was identified in the systemic reactions. All adverse effects were transient and resolved within a few days. Moreover, the neutralizing and IgG antibody levels post different dose vaccinations were all significantly increased at day 14/21 (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0003, respectively) and day 28/35 (P < 0.00001) in vaccine groups compared to placebo controls. Besides, the levels of neutralizing and IgG antibodies were also elevated significantly at from day 14 to 35, versus day 0 (All P < 0.001).

105,17763,"Design and implementation of the multi-arm, multi-stage Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO) platform master protocol: An Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) initiative","1BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a public health emergency. Safe and effective therapies are urgently needed.

MethodsTherapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO), is a global multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) platform master protocol, which facilitates the rapid evaluation of the safety and efficacy of candidate anti-viral therapeutic agents for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The protocol design allows multiple therapeutic agents to be evaluated in an efficient and scientifically rigorous manner, with efficiencies delivered by the MAMS design, and began by studying neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. TICO employs an agile and robust approach to futility and safety evaluation at 300 patients enrolled (Stage 1), with subsequent expansion to full sample size and an expanded target population (Stage 2) if the agent shows an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy. Two ordinal outcomes applied early (Day 5) determine the efficacy signals of the investigational agents(s) and progression to Stage 2. These ordinal outcomes assess both respiratory and other organ failure events, recognizing the broad range of COVID-19 morbidity. In Stage 2, overall efficacy is assessed using the primary outcome of  time to sustained recovery assessed over 90 days. This approach to early futility assessment using an early intermediate outcome and a primary endpoint out to 90 days allows the study team to make rapid decisions on safety and potential efficacy of novel agents while ultimately focusing on patient-centered, longer-term outcomes. The implementation of TICO across a global network allows for continued enrollment despite variations in geographic epidemiology.

Study StatusThe TICO master protocol moved from conception to first patient enrolled in approximately 9 weeks, a testament to the expedited regulatory and ethics review, coupled with flexible and responsive study operations. The first agent to be tested using this protocol, LY-CoV-555, enrolled N=326 participants before undergoing Stage 1 futility and safety assessment. Two additional agents will enter the study in November 2020, with other agents planned.

ConclusionThe TICO MAMS platform trial has been implemented efficiently across a global network of sites and several trial networks. It will generate results rapidly for multiple novel neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutics agents.",13/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.08.20227876,Daniel D Murray,"CHIP Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity, and Infections, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark",medrxiv,0,0
107,17992,Continued Age Shift of Confirmed Positive COVID-19 Incidence Over Time to Children and Young Adults: Washington State March - August 2020,"BackgroundAs the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic passed the initial infection peak in Washington State, phased re-opening lifted stay-at-home orders and restrictions leading to increased non-essential work, social activities and gathering, especially among younger persons.

MethodsA longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution 1) March-April 2020 (N=13,934) and 2) March-August 2020 (N=76,032) for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance.

ResultsFrom March 1st to April 19, 2020 COVID-19 case positive age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p <.001). Number of cases over the eight-week analysis period were 0-19 years n = 515, 20-39 years n = 4078, 40-59 years n =4788, 60-79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. After the peak (March 22, 2020), as incidence declined in older age groups, the combined percentage of cases age 0-19 and 20-39 increased from 20% to 40% of total cases. During this time testing expanded with more testing among older age groups while case positivity shifted young. Percent positive cases by age through August 2020 increased to a consistent average of 60% less than age 40 [age 0-19 increased to 19% (N = 10257), age 20-39 increased to 42% (N = 30215)].

ConclusionsAn increased share of COVID-19 incidence among children (age 0-19) and young adults (age 20-39) indicates their elevated role in propagating the epidemic by creating a reservoir of disease with risk of spillovers to more vulnerable older persons and those with comorbid conditions. Media savvy and age appropriate COVID-19 messaging may increase mitigation compliance among these less vulnerable, more mobile and lower priority vaccination age groups. As vaccines become available, mitigation will continue to be a priority to reduce overall population incidence.",16/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.12.20229468,Judith Malmgren,University of Washington,medrxiv,0,0

109,18114,Low Dose Radiation Therapy for COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Pilot Study,"BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as pandemic in March 2020. Currently there is no vaccine or specific effective treatment for COVID-19. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. Radiation in low doses (<100 cGy) has been known for its anti-inflammatory effect and therefore, low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) to lungs can potentially mitigate the severity of pneumonia and reduce mortality. We conducted a pilot trial to study the feasibility and clinical efficacy of LDRT to lungs in the management of patients with COVID-19.

MethodsFrom June to Aug 2020, we enrolled 10 patients with COVID-19 having moderate to severe risk disease [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of [&ge;]5]. Patients were treated as per the standard COVID-19 management guidelines along with LDRT to both lungs with a dose of 70cGy in single fraction. Response assessment was done based on the clinical parameters using the NEWS.

ResultsAll patients completed the prescribed treatment. Nine patients had complete clinical recovery mostly within a period ranging from 3-7 days. One patient, who was a known hypertensive, showed clinical deterioration and died 24 days after LDRT. No patients showed the signs of acute radiation toxicity.

ConclusionResults of our study (90% response rate) suggest the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of LDRT in COVID-19 patients having moderate to severe risk disease. This mandates a randomized controlled trial to establish the clinical efficacy of LDRT in COVID-19 pneumonia.",18/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.16.20231514,Daya Nand Sharma,"AIIMS, New Delhi",medrxiv,0,0
110,18222,Assessment of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in Los Angeles,"ImportanceHealthcare workers (HCW) are slated to be early recipients of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines due to increased risk of exposure to patients with COVID-19, and will be tasked with administering approved vaccines to the general population. As lynchpins of the vaccination effort, HCWs opinions of a vaccines safety and efficacy may affect both public perception and uptake of the vaccine. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and address potential hesitancy prior to vaccine administration.

ObjectiveTo understand healthcare workers attitudes about vaccine safety, efficacy, and acceptability in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including acceptance of a novel coronavirus vaccine.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsA cross-sectional survey was distributed to participants enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study surveilling SARS-CoV-2 infection among 1,093 volunteer sampled University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System employees. Surveys were completed online between September 24 and October 16, 2020. In total, 609 participants completed this supplemental survey.

ResultsWe averaged a 9-statement Likert scale matrix scored from 1 (""strongly disagree"") to 5 (""strongly agree"") and found respondents overwhelmingly confident about vaccine safety (4.47); effectiveness (4.44); importance, self-protection, and community health (4.67). Notably, 47.3% of respondents reported unwillingness to participate in a coronavirus vaccine trial, and most (66.5%) intend to delay vaccination. The odds of reporting intent to delay coronavirus vaccine uptake were 4.15 times higher among nurses, 2.45 times higher among other personnel with patient contact roles, and 2.15 times higher among those without patient contact compared to doctors. Evolving SARS-CoV-2 science (76.0%), current political climate (57.6%), and fast-tracked vaccine development timeline (83.4%) were cited as primary variables impacting HCW decisions to undergo vaccination. Of note, these results were obtained prior to release of Phase III data from companies manufacturing vaccines in the U.S.

Conclusions and RelevanceDespite overall confidence in vaccines, a majority of HCW expressed concerns over a novel coronavirus vaccine. A large proportion plan to delay vaccine uptake due to concerns about expedited development, emerging scientific discoveries, and the political climate. Forthcoming vaccination campaigns must address these unique points of coronavirus vaccine hesitancy in order to achieve adequate vaccine coverage.",19/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.18.20234468,Anne W Rimoin,"University of California, Los Angeles",medrxiv,0,0
111,18495,Exploring Risks of Human Challenge Trials for COVID-19,"Human Challenge Trials (HCTs) are a potential method to accelerate development of vaccines and therapeutics. However, HCTs for COVID-19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this paper, we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a SARS-COV-2 dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID-19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality rates (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. We have also created a web tool to explore risk under different study design parameters and participant scenarios. Finally, we use our model to estimate individual risk, as well as the overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study.

Based on the Bayesian model we expect IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age to be 17.5 in 100,000, with 95% uncertainty interval from 12.8 to 23.6. Using this estimate, we find that a simple 50-person dosing trial using younger individuals has a 99.1% (95% CI: 98.8% to 99.4%) probability of no fatalities, and a 92.8% (95% CI: 90.3% to 94.6%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization. However, this IFR will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, as well as providing medical care and aggressive treatment for any cases which occur, so that with stronger assumptions, we project the risk to be as low as 3.1 per 100,000, with a 99.85% (95% CI: 99.7% to 99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.7% (95% CI: 97.4% to 99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization.",26/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.19.20234658,David Manheim,1DaySooner,medrxiv,0,0
112,18262,"COVID-19 optimal vaccination policies: a modeling study on efficacy, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses","At the date, Europe and part of North America face the second wave of COVID-19, causing more than 1 300 000 deaths worldwide. Humanity lacks successful treatments, and a sustainable solution is an effective vaccine. Pfizer and the Russian Gamaleya Institute report that its vaccines reach more than 90 % efficacy in a recent press release. If third stage trial results favorable, pharmaceutical firms estimate big scale production of its vaccine candidates around the first 2021 quarter and the World Health organization fix as objective, vaccinate 20 % of the whole population at the final of 2021. However, since COVID-19 is new to our knowledge, vaccine efficacy and induced-immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but few think the first vaccines will be fully protective. Instead, they may reduce the severity of illness, reducing hospitalization and death cases.

Further, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. For this reason, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses.

Our contribution answers questions in this direction. According to the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization Working Group on COVID-19 Vaccines, we formulate an optimal controlled model to describe vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. Additionally, we analyze the reproductive vaccination number according to vaccination profiles depending on coverage, efficacy, horizon time, and vaccination rate. We explore scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced immunity, and natural immunity via numerical simulation. Our results suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and natural immunity would play a dominant role in the vaccination policy design. Likewise, the vaccine efficacy would influence the time of intensifying the number of doses in the vaccination policy.",20/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.19.20235176,Saul Diaz-Infante,CONACYT - Universidad de Sonora,medrxiv,0,0
113,18365,BCG vaccine derived peptides induce SARS-CoV-2 T cell cross-reactivity,"Epidemiological studies suggest that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine may have protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and, there are now more than 15 ongoing clinical trials seeking to determine if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 (1). However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific T cell response is unknown. Here, in silico, we identify 8 BCG derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 or NSP13 derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its corresponding SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG derived peptides. Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG derived peptides developed enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the epidemiologic observation that BCG vaccination confers protection from COVID-19; and supports the use of BCG vaccination to induce cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses.",23/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.21.20236018,Joshua D Ooi,Monash University,medrxiv,0,0
114,18444,Evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid systematic review,"ObjectiveTo review evidence of the effectiveness of travel measures implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to recommend change on how evidence is incorporated in the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).

DesignWe used an abbreviated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) and a search strategy aimed to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures (advice, entry and exit screening, medical examination or vaccination requirements, isolation or quarantine, the refusal of entry, and entry restrictions), pre-printed or published by June 1, 2020.

ResultsWe identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled (vs. observational). Thirteen studies investigated international measures while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both), including suspended transportation (24 studies), border restrictions (21), and screening (5). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the identified studies investigated the initial export of cases out of Wuhan, which was found to be highly effective, but few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures failed to account for domestic travel measures, and thus likely led to biased estimates. Poor data and other factors contributed to the low quality of the studies identified.

ConclusionTravel measures, especially those implemented in Wuhan, played a key role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the effectiveness of these measures was short-lived. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps, but also a need to review the way in which evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak.

What is already known on this subject?O_LIPrevious reviews of the evidence from outbreaks of influenza and other infectious disease have generally found that there is limited evidence that travel-measures are effective at containing outbreaks.
C_LIO_LIHowever, it is unclear if the lessons from other infectious disease outbreaks would be relevant in the context of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIBased on evidence at the time, WHO did not recommend any travel restrictions when it declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
C_LI

What does this study add?O_LIThis study rapidly reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of travel measures implemented in the early phase of the pandemic on epidemiological countries.
C_LIO_LIThe study investigated both international and domestic travel measures and a wide range of travel measures.
C_LIO_LIThe study finds that the domestic travel measures implemented in Wuhan were effective at reducing the importation of cases internationally and within China. The study also finds that travel measures are more effective when implemented earlier in the outbreak.
C_LIO_LIThe findings generate recommendations on how to incorporate evidence into the International Health Regulations and highlights important research gaps that remain.
C_LI

How might this affect future outbreaks?O_LIThe findings of this study suggest the need to decouple recommendations of travel measures from the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.
C_LIO_LIHighlights the need to evaluate the potential effectiveness of travel measures for each outbreak, and not just assume effectiveness based on past outbreak scnearios.

115,18443,"Optimal symptom combinations to aid COVID-19 case identification: analysis from a community-based, prospective, observational cohort","ObjectivesDiagnostic work-up following any COVID-19 associated symptom will lead to extensive testing, potentially overwhelming laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding negative results. We aimed to identify optimal symptom combinations to capture most cases using fewer tests with implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers across different resource settings and public health.

MethodsUK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one case (test per case [TPC]) were calculated for different symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

FindingsUK and US cohorts included 122,305 (1,202 positives) and 3,162 (79 positive) individuals. Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 TPC. The combination with highest sensitivity (fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat) identified 96% cases requiring 96 TPC.

InterpretationWe confirmed the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms for triggering RT-PCR and identified additional symptom combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity that maximize case capture given different resource settings.

116,18525,Are we ready for COVID-19's Golden Passport? Insights from a Global Physician Survey,"IntroductionCOVID-19 immunity passports could protect the right to free movement, but critics worry about insufficient evidence, privacy, fraud, and discrimination. We aimed to characterize the global physician communitys opinion regarding immunity passports.

MethodsCross sectional, random stratified sample of physicians registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. The survey aimed to sample 1,000 physicians divided among the USA, EU and rest of the world. The survey question on immunology asked physicians to offer their insights into whether we know enough about COVID-19 immunity and its duration to offer immunity passports at the present time.

ResultsThe survey was completed by 1004 physicians (67 specialties, 40 countries, 49% frontline specialties) with a mean (SD) age of 49.14 (12) years. Overall, 52% answered NO, 17% were UNCERTAIN, and 31% answered YES (P <0.05). EU physicians were more likely to sayYES but even among them it did not exceed 35% approval. US physicians (60%) were more likely to say NO.

ConclusionOur findings suggest a current lack of support among physicians for immunity passports. It is hoped that ongoing research and vaccine trials will provide further clarity.",29/01/2021,10.1101/2020.11.25.20234195,Alexandra Rose Linares,Duke University School of Medicine,medrxiv,0,0
117,18689,Title: Immunity status of Health Care Workers post recovery from COVID-19: An online longitudinal panel survey,"BackgroundCorona virus has literally travelled ""around the world in 80 days"" akin to Fogg and Passepartoute of Jules Verne fame. Manning of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wards and ICUs, also surgery on COVID-positive patients is increasingly being relegated to that subset of health care workers (HCW) who themselves have resumed duties after surviving COVID-19 infection. Convalescent plasma therapy has been widely endorsed. Several vaccines are in the pipeline as potential preventive measures against the virus keeping HCW on the priority-list of recipients. Immunity passports are being validated for foreign travel. These events share a common presumption that exposure to COVID-19 virus (natural infection/inoculation) produces protective adaptive immunity. It is unknown whether all (COVID-19) infected patients mount a protective immune response and for how long any protective effect will last.

MethodsThis single institutional prospective longitudinal panel survey questions were deployed to the respondents online via email/WhatsApp groups to ascertain the symptomology and immunity status of HCW in the months following COVID-19 infection. The survey was administered to the same set/cohort of health care workers over 6 months.

Results165 responses from 151 respondents (70 at 1-2months; 95 at 3-4 months including 14 at both time points) were analysed. 7.14% of infected HCW failed to develop IgG antibodies at 4-6 weeks. 91.7% HCW with IgG titres in the highest bracket had experienced anosmia. Mean antibody titres were 12.08 {+/-} 9.56 and 9.72 {+/-} 9.34 at 1-2 months and 3-4 months post-development of first symptom, respectively.

ConclusionUnderstanding of COVID-19 patterns of variation in HCW may guide their deployment in the COVID ward and COVID-OTs. Revelation of this enigma (by quantification of serial IgG antibody levels) is critical for predicting response to vaccines under trial, fostering effective stratagems and tactics for pandemic control, ascertaining validity of immunity passports and understanding longevity/durability of protection by forecasting immunological memory against SARS-CoV-2.",30/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.27.20239426,Shagun Bhatia Shah,Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre,medrxiv,0,0
118,18718,CLINICAL TRIALS IN COVID-19 MANAGEMENT & PREVENTION: A META-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY EXAMINING METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has produced a large number of clinical trial reports with unprecedented rapidity, raising concerns about methodological quality and potential for research waste.

ObjectivesTo describe the characteristics of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating prophylaxis or treatment of Covid-19 infection and examine the effect of trial characteristics on whether the study reported a statistically significant effect on the primary outcome(s).

Study DesignMeta-epidemiological study of Covid-19 treatment and prophylaxis RCTs.

Eligibility criteriaEnglish-language RCTs (peer-reviewed or preprint) that evaluated pharmacologic agents or blood products compared to standard care, placebo, or an active comparator among participants with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 or at risk for Covid-19. We excluded trials of vaccines or traditional herbal medicines.

Information sourcesWe searched 25 databases in the US Centre for Disease Control Downloadable Database from January 1 to October 21, 2020.

Trial appraisal and synthesis methodsWe extracted trial characteristics including number of centres, funding sources (industry versus non-industry), and sample size. We assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the modified Cochrane RoB 2.0 Tool. We used descriptive statistics to summarize trial characteristics and logistic regression to evaluate the association between RoB due to the randomization process, centre status (single vs. multicentre), funding source, and sample size, and statistically significant effect in the primary outcome.

ResultsWe included 91 RCTs (46,802 participants) evaluating Covid-19 therapeutic drugs (n = 76), blood products (n = 9) or prophylactic drugs (n = 6). Of these, 40 (44%) were single-centre, 23 (25.3%) enrolled < 50 patients, and 28 (30.8%) received industry funding. RoB varied across trials, with high or probably high overall RoB in 75 (82.4%) trials, most frequently due to deviations from the intended protocol (including blinding) and randomization processes. Thirty-eight trials (41.8%) found a statistically significant effect in the primary outcome. RoB due randomization (odds ratio [OR] 3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 9.72) and single centre trials (OR 3.15, 95% CI, 1.25 to 7.97) were associated with higher likelihood of finding a statistically significant effect.

ConclusionsThere was high variability in RoB amongst Covid-19 trials. RoB attributed to the randomization process and single centre status were associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of finding a statistically significant effect. Researchers, funders, and knowledge users should remain cognizant of the impact of study characteristics, including RoB, on trial results when designing, conducting, and appraising Covid-19 trials.",30/11/2020,10.1101/2020.11.29.20237875,Kimia Honarmand,Western University,medrxiv,0,0
119,18731,What is the uncertainty in efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines? A Bayesian analysis,"This short paper reports a Bayesian analysis of the publicly available COVID-19 trial results. The analysis casts some doubts on whether the half+full dose regime of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is truly more effective than the 2x full dose regime. The 95% posterior interval for the efficacy of the half+full dose regime is 66.6-96.3%, while for the 2x full dose regime it is 39.0-74.8%. Hence, it is possible that in both dosage regimes the vaccine has similar efficacy, around 70%. The estimated efficacy for the Pfizer vaccine is 89.9-97.4% and for Moderna 86.3-97.5%. These results should be interpreted with care though, since this analysis does not account for differences in for instance trial population, COVID-19 testing, and storage requirements for the various vaccines.",03/12/2020,10.1101/2020.11.30.20240671,Phebo D Wibbens,INSEAD,medrxiv,0,0
121,19041,Sulodexide in the treatment of patients with early stages of COVID-19: a randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundTargeting endothelial cells has been suggested for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and sulodexide has pleiotropic properties within the vascular endothelium that can prove beneficial to the same. We aimed to evaluate the effect of sulodexide when used in the early clinical stages of COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a single-centre, outpatient setting, randomised controlled trial with a parallel-group design in Mexico. Including patients within three days of clinical symptom onset, who were at a high risk of severe clinical progression due to chronic comorbidities. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an oral dose of sulodexide (500 LRU twice a day) or the placebo for 21 days. Primary outcomes were need and length of hospitalisation, need and length of oxygen support.

ResultsBetween June 5 and August 30, 2020, 243 patients were included in the ""per-protocol"" analysis. One hundred twenty-four of them received sulodexide, while 119 received placeboes. At 21 days follow-up, 22 of 124 patients required hospitalisation in the sulodexide group compared to 35 of 119 in the placebo group [relative risk (RR), 0{middle dot}6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0{middle dot}37-0{middle dot}96; p=0{middle dot}03]. Fewer patients required oxygen support in the sulodexide group [37 of 124 vs. 50 of 119; RR, 0{middle dot}71; 95% CI, 0{middle dot}5 to 1; p=0{middle dot}05], and for fewer days (9{+/-}7{middle dot}2 in the sulodexide group vs. 11{middle dot}5{+/-}9{middle dot}6 in the placebo group; p=0{middle dot}02). There was no between-group difference concerning the length of hospital stay.

InterpretationEarly intervention in COVID-19 patients with sulodexide reduced hospital admissions and oxygen support requirements, although with no significant effect on mortality. This has beneficial implications in the patient well-being, making sulodexide a favourable medication until an effective vaccine or an antiviral becomes available.

122,19029,"Multifaceted strategies for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundCOVID-19 has caused severe outbreaks in Canadian long-term care facilities (LTCFs).

ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including routine testing of staff and vaccination of staff and residents.

DesignAgent-based transmission model parameterized with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal (NP) and saliva testing, preliminary results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada.

SettingCharacteristics of staff and residents were included in the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and deaths, calibrated to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 reported in these settings.

ParticipantsSynthetic staff and resident populations.

InterventionsRoutine NP and saliva testing of staff; vaccination of residents and staff.

MeasurementsDaily incidence and attack rates in the LTCF using large-scale model simulations; estimates of hospitalizations and deaths and their 95% credible intervals.

ResultsWeekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 20.3% (95% CrI: 18.7-21.8%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2-4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 81.4% (95% CrI: 80.6-82.2%), and 82.1% (95% CrI: 81.5-82.7%), respectively.

LimitationsTimelines of vaccine distribution and compliance rates with routine testing are key parameters affecting strategy outcomes.

ConclusionRoutine testing of staff reduces silent transmission in LTCFs. Vaccination could have a substantial impact on mitigating disease burden among residents, but may not eliminate the need for other measures before population-level control of COVID-19 is achieved.",07/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.04.20244194,Seyed M.

123,19016,On the Effects of Misclassification in Estimating Efficacy With Application to Recent COVID-19 Vaccine Trials,"The recent trials for COVID-19 vaccines have garnered a considerable amount of attention and (as of this writing) vaccinations are just getting underway. The popular summaries of these trials give infection rates in the vaccinated and placebo and estimated efficacy, which for the two trials we focus on (Moderna and Pfizer) are both near 95%. This paper explores the potential effects of possible false positives or false negatives (misclassification) in the COVID-19 diagnosis with specific numerical investigations pertinent to the Moderna and Pfizer trials. The general conclusion, fortunately, is that these potential misclassifications almost always would lead to underestimation of the efficacy and that correcting for false positives or negatives will lead to even higher estimated efficacy.",21/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.04.20244244,John P Buonaccorsi,University of Massachusetts-Amherst,medrxiv,0,0
124,19035,Exploring drugs and vaccines associated with altered risks and severity of COVID-19: a UK Biobank cohort study of all ATC level-4 drug categories,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a major public health concern, yet its risk factors are not well-understood and effective therapies are lacking. It remains unclear how different drugs may increase or decrease the risks of infection and severity of disease.

MethodsWe studied associations of prior use of all level-4 ATC drug categories (including vaccines) with COVID-19 diagnosis and outcome, based on a prospective cohort of UK Biobank(UKBB). Drug history was based on general practitioner(GP) records. Effects of prescribed medications/vaccinations on the risk of infection, severity of disease and mortality were investigated separately. Hospitalized and fatal cases were categorized as  severe infection. We also considered different study designs and conducted analyses within infected patients, tested subjects and the whole population respectively, and for 5 different time-windows of prescriptions. Missing data were accounted for by multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting was employed to reduce testing bias. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted which controls for main confounders.

ResultsWe placed a greater focus on protective associations here, as (residual) confounding by indication and comorbidities tends to bias towards harmful effects. Across all categories, statins showed the strongest and most consistent protective associations. Significant protective effects against severe infection were seen among infected subjects (OR for prescriptions within a 12-month window, same below: 0.50, 95% CI:0.42-0.60), tested subjects (OR=0.63, 0.54-0.73) or in the general population (OR=0.49, 0.42-0.57). A number of top-listed drugs with protective effects were also cardiovascular medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blocker and beta-blockers. Some other drugs showing protective associations included biguanides (metformin), estrogens, thyroid hormones and proton pump inhibitors, among others.

Interestingly, we also observed protective associations by numerous vaccines. The most consistent association was observed for influenza vaccines, which showed reduced odds of infection (OR= 0.73 for vaccination in past year, CI 0.65-0.83) when compared cases to general population controls or test-negative controls (OR=0.60, 0.53-0.68). Protective associations were also observed when severe or fatal infection was considered as the outcome. Pneumococcal, tetanus, typhoid and combined bacterial and viral vaccines (ATC code J07CA) were also associated with lower odds of infection/severity.

Further subgroup and interaction analyses revealed difference in protective effects in different clinical subgroups. For example, protective effects of flu and pneumococcal vaccines were weaker in obese individuals, while we observed stronger protective effects of statins in those with cardiometabolic disorders, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension and obesity.

ConclusionsA number of drugs, including many for cardiometabolic disorders, may be associated with lower odds of infection/severity of infection.

125,19250,A Simplified Bayesian Analysis Method for Vaccine Efficacy,"We describe a simplified Bayesian analysis of vaccine trial data, in which a reparametrization of the Poisson likelihood leads to a factorization in which the protective vaccine efficacy VES and the nuisance parameter appear in different factors. As a consequence the posterior density acquires a factorized form, and marginalization over the nuisance parameter is trivial. Estimates of VES accordingly become a matter of simple manipulations of one-dimensional posterior probability densities. We demonstrate the method using the publically-released data on the efficacy of three vaccines agains SARS-CoV-2: the final Phase III data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines and the interim data released for the Sputnik V adenovirus-based vaccine.",11/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.07.20244954,Carlo Graziani,Argonne National Laboratory,medrxiv,0,0
126,19094,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays for antibody monitoring in natural infection and vaccine trials,"Determinants of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the development of well-standardized, reproducible antibody assays to be utilized in concert with clinical trials to establish correlates of risk and protection. This need has led to the appearance of a variety of neutralization assays used by different laboratories and companies. Using plasma samples from COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate disease from a localized outbreak in a single region of the western US, we compared three platforms for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization: assay with live SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus assay utilizing lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging, and a surrogate ELISA test. Vero, Vero E6, HEK293T cells expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were evaluated. Live-virus and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T cells showed similar geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging 141-178, but VSV-pseudovirus assay yielded significantly higher GMT (310 95%CI 211-454; p < 0.001). Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) titers from live-virus and all pseudovirus assay readouts were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81-0.89). ND50 titers positively correlated with plasma concentration of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) (r = 0.63-0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46-0.73). There was a moderate positive correlation between age and spike (Spearmans rho=0.37, p=0.02), RBD (rho=0.39, p=0.013) and nucleoprotein IgG (rho=0.45, p=0.003). ND80 showed stronger correlation with age than ND50 (ND80 rho=0.51 (p=0.001), ND50 rho=0.28 (p=0.075)).

127,19207,Artificial intelligence-enabled analysis of UK and US public attitudes on Facebook and Twitter towards COVID-19 vaccinations,"BackgroundGlobal efforts towards the development and deployment of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly advancing. We developed and applied an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the UK and the US towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to understand public attitude and identify topics of concern.

MethodsOver 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1st March - 22nd November 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.

ResultsWe found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.

ConclusionsAI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. This could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccinations, help address concerns of vaccine-sceptics and develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximise uptake.",11/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.08.20246231,Amir Hussain,"Edinburgh Napier University, UK",medrxiv,0,0
129,19268,"Projecting the impact of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundResults of phase III vaccine clinical trials against COVID-19, although encouraging and well above initial expectations, have only reported on efficacy against disease and its severity. We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada.

MethodsWe used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes derived from outbreak data. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program, prioritizing healthcare workers and high-risk individuals, with 40% vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy of 95% against disease. Vaccines were distributed at a rate of 30 doses per day per 10,000 population with a 6-day schedule per week. We projected the impact of vaccination on attack rates, hospitalizations, and deaths. For scenario analyses, we varied the vaccine efficacy against infection, under the assumption of 5% pre-existing population immunity.

ResultsWith no protection against infection, a two-dose vaccination campaign with a time interval of 21 days between doses reduced attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths by 44.6% (95% CrI: 34.5% - 54.3%), 63.4% (95% CrI: 56.1% - 69.9%), and 70.0% (95% CrI: 62.6% - 75.8%), respectively. These reductions were improved with increased vaccine efficacy against infection, with similar estimated ranges in the corresponding scenarios with a 28-day time interval between vaccine doses.

ConclusionsVaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, even when vaccines offer limited protection against infection. This impact is founded upon a relatively strong vaccine efficacy against disease and severe outcomes.",11/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.10.20246827,Kevin Zhang,University of Toronto,medrxiv,0,0
131,19343,Public Preferences for Social Distancing Behaviors to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"Policies to promote social distancing can minimize COVID-19 transmission, but come with substantial social and economic costs. Quantifying relative preferences of the public for such practices can inform policy prioritization and optimize uptake. We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to quantify relative ""utilities"" (preferences) for five COVID-19 pandemic social distances strategies (e.g., closure of restaurants, restriction of large gatherings) against the hypothetical risk of acquiring COVID-19 and anticipated income loss. The survey was distributed in Missouri in May-June, 2020. We applied inverse probability sampling weights to mixed logit and latent class models to generate mean preferences and identify preference classes. Overall (n=2,428), the strongest preference was for the prohibition of large gatherings, followed by preferences to keep outdoor venues, schools, and social and lifestyle venues open, 75% of the population showing probable support for a strategy that prohibited large gatherings and closed lifestyle and social venues. Latent class analysis, however revealed four preference sub-groups in the population - ""risk eliminators"", ""risk balancers"", ""altruistic"" and ""risk takers"", with men twice as likely as women to belong to the risk-taking group. In this setting, public health policies which as a first phase prohibit large gatherings, as well as close social and lifestyle venues may be acceptable and adhered to by the public. In addition, policy messages that address preference heterogeneity, for example by targeting public health messages at men, could improve adherence to social distancing measures and prevent further COVID-19 transmission prior to vaccine distribution and in the event of future pandemics.

Significance StatementPreferences drive behavior - DCEs are a novel tool in public health that allow examination of preferences for a product, service or policy, identifying how the public prioritizes personal risks and cost in relation to health behaviors. Using this method to establish preferences for COVID-19 mitigation strategies, our results suggest that, firstly, a tiered approach to non-essential business closures where large gatherings are prohibited and social and lifestyle venues are closed as a first phase, would be well aligned with population preferences and may be supported by the public, while school and outdoor venue closures may require more consideration prior to a second phase of restrictions. And secondly, that important distinct preference phenotypes - that are not captured by sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex, race) characteristics - exist, and therefore that messaging should be target at such subgroups to enhance adherence to prevention efforts.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.12.20248103,Ingrid Eshun-Wilson,Washington University in St. Louis,medrxiv,0,0
132,19389,Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission may prevent or dampen a spring wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths in 2021,"Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials assess vaccine efficacy against disease (VEDIS), the ability of a vaccine to block symptomatic COVID-19. They will only partially discriminate whether VEDIS is mediated by preventing infection as defined by the detection of virus in the airways (vaccine efficacy against infection defined as VESUSC), or by preventing symptoms despite breakthrough infection (vaccine efficacy against symptoms or VESYMP). Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEINF), defined as the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine recipients versus from infected placebo recipients, is also not being measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King County Washington, we demonstrate that if the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which have observed VEDIS>90%, mediate VEDIS predominately by complete protection against infection, then prevention of a fourth epidemic wave in the spring of 2021, and associated reduction of subsequent cases and deaths by 60%, is likely to occur assuming rapid enough vaccine roll out. If high VEDIS is explained primarily by reduction in symptoms, then VEINF>50% will be necessary to prevent or limit the extent of this fourth epidemic wave. The potential added benefits of high VEINF would be evident regardless of vaccine allocation strategy and would be enhanced if vaccine roll out rate is low or if available vaccines demonstrate waning immunity. Finally, we demonstrate that a 1.0 log vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to achieve VEINF=60% and that human challenge studies with 104 infected participants, or clinical trials in a university student population could estimate VESUSC, VESYMP and VEINF using viral load metrics.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.13.20248120,Joshua T Schiffer,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,medrxiv,0,0
133,19334,COVID-19 vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not block infection need higher coverage and faster rollout to achieve population impact,"BackgroundSeveral COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in the final stage of testing. Interim trial results for two vaccines suggest at least 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease (VEDIS). It remains unknown whether this efficacy is mediated predominately by lowering SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility (VESUSC) or development of symptoms after infection (VESYMP). A vaccine with high VESYMP but low VESUSC has uncertain population impact.

MethodsWe developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to demographic, physical distancing and epidemic data from King County, Washington. Different rollout scenarios starting December 2020 were simulated assuming different combinations of VESUSC and VESYMP resulting in up to 100% VEDIS with constant vaccine effects over 1 year. We assumed no further increase in physical distancing despite expanding case numbers and no reduction of infectivity upon infection conditional on presence of symptoms. Proportions of cumulative infections, hospitalizations and deaths prevented over 1 year from vaccination start are reported.

ResultsRollouts of 1M vaccinations (5,000 daily) using vaccines with 50% VEDIS are projected to prevent 30%-58% of infections and 38%-58% of deaths over one year. In comparison, vaccines with 90% VEDIS are projected to prevent 47%-78% of the infections and 58%-77% of deaths over one year. In both cases, there is a greater reduction if VEDIS is mediated mostly by VESUSC. The use of a ""symptom reducing"" vaccine will require twice as many people vaccinated than a ""susceptibility reducing"" vaccine with the same 90% VEDIS to prevent 50% of the infections and death over one year. Delaying the start of the vaccination by 3 months decreases the expected population impact by approximately 40%.

ConclusionsVaccines which prevent COVID-19 disease but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby shift symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, will prevent fewer infections and require larger and faster vaccination rollouts to have population impact, compared to vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection. If uncontrolled transmission across the U.S. continues, then expected vaccination in Spring 2021 will provide only limited benefit.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.13.20248142,Dobromir T Dimitrov,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,medrxiv,0,0
134,19388,Assessing Durability of Vaccine Effect Following Blinded Crossover in COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials,"BackgroundSeveral candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 disease have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials and some have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. Efficacious vaccines should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which will occur before long-term efficacy and safety are known.

MethodsFollowing vaccination of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be derived by assuming the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both vaccine durability and potential vaccine-associated enhanced disease.

ResultsPost-crossover estimates of vaccine efficacy can provide insights about durability, identify waning efficacy, and identify late enhancement of disease, but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As vaccine efficacy estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior vaccine efficacy estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late vaccine efficacy. Further, open-label crossover may lead to riskier behavior in the immediate crossover period for the unblinded vaccine arm, confounding vaccine efficacy estimates for all post-crossover periods.

ConclusionsWe advocate blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess vaccine durability and potential delayed enhancement of disease. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunological and clinical effectiveness over time.",14/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.14.20248137,Dean Follmann,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,medrxiv,0,0
135,19498,SARS-CoV-2 shifting transmission dynamics and hidden reservoirs limited the efficacy of public health interventions in Italy,"We investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Italy, one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, using phylodynamic analysis of viral genetic and epidemiological data. We observed the co-circulation of at least 13 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time, which were linked to multiple importations and characterized by large transmission clusters concomitant with a high number of infections. Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as ""hidden reservoirs"" during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave. Our results suggest that the efficacy of public health interventions is, ultimately, limited by the size and structure of epidemic reservoirs, which may warrant prioritization during vaccine deployment.",19/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.16.20248355,Massimo Ciccozzi,Campus Biomedical University of Rome,medrxiv,0,0

MethodsWe examined data in both vaccine trials, provided 95% confidence intervals, and projected the cases that would be prevented in communities of multi-million population.

ResultsThe 95% confidence intervals reveal that the true vaccine efficacy could be as low as 86% for stated efficacy of 94.4% in an interim report, indicating the inaccuracy and uncertainty of efficacy point estimate. Both vaccines achieve an efficacy above 89% by the 95% confidence interval in updated reports. The Moderna vaccine would prevent more than 50,260 cases in communities of 1 million people with 1 year exposure.

139,19864,REAL-TIME MECHANISTIC BAYESIAN FORECASTS OF COVID-19 MORTALITY,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late December 2019. In the first six months of the global outbreak, the US reported more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. Effective modeling of the course of the pandemic can help assist with public health resource planning, intervention efforts, and vaccine clinical trials. However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR model. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model and show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top 2 models out of 10 submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.",24/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.22.20248736,Daniel Sheldon,University of Massachusetts Amherst,medrxiv,0,0
140,19881,"Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during 9-months of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden","Structured abstractO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSAs Sweden did not enforce social lockdown in response to the pandemic, it is critical to establish seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy, active adults - here represented by blood donors and pregnant women. Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the countrys most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of population seropositivity in response to natural infection.

DesignIn this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n=2,100) and pregnant women (n=2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three intervals) between 14th March and 11th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large cohort of historical controls (n=595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807.

SettingHealthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through the Karolinska University Hospital.

ParticipantsNone of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the samples.

ResultsBlood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened (n=56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response.

ConclusionsIn agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2.

General abstractPublic health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world. In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n=4,100) were sampled at random between 14th March-11th December 2020. All individuals (n=200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results were compared with those from historical controls (n=595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9 months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the end of 2020.",26/12/2020,10.1101/2020.12.24.20248821,Xaquin C Dopico,Karolinska Institutet,medrxiv,0,0
141,19971,Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"BackgroundVaccination is crucial to address the COVID-19 pandemic but vaccine hesitancy could undermine control efforts. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK population, identify which population subgroups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and report stated reasons for vaccine hesitancy.

MethodsNationally representative survey data from 12,035 participants were collected from 24th November to 1st December 2020 for wave 6 of the  Understanding Society COVID-19 web survey. Participants were asked how likely or unlikely they would be to have a vaccine if offered and their main reason for hesitancy. Cross-sectional analysis assessed prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and logistic regression models conducted.

FindingsOverall intention to be vaccinated was high (82% likely/very likely). Vaccine hesitancy was higher in women (21.0% vs 14.7%), younger age groups (26.5% in 16-24 year olds vs 4.5% in 75+) and less educated (18.6% no qualifications vs 13.2% degree qualified). Vaccine hesitancy was particularly high in Black (71.8%), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (42.3%), Mixed (32.4%) and non-UK/Irish White (26.4%) ethnic groups. Fully adjusted models showed gender, education and ethnicity were independently associated with vaccine hesitancy. Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy were 12.96 (95% CI:7.34, 22.89) in the Black/Black British and 2.31 (95% CI:1.55, 3.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups (compared to White British/Irish ethnicity) and 3.24 (95%CI:1.93, 5.45) for people with no qualifications compared to degree educated. The main reason for hesitancy was fears over unknown future effects.

InterpretationOlder people at greatest COVID-19 mortality risk expressed the greatest willingness to be vaccinated but Black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups had greater vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine programmes should prioritise measures to improve uptake in specific minority ethnic groups.

FundingMedical Research Council

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Embase and Medline up to November 16, 2020, using key words ""vaccine hesitancy"" and ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"". Vaccine hesitancy is complex but also context specific. Previous research about vaccine hesitancy relates to existing adult and childhood vaccines, with limited evidence currently available on willingness to be vaccinated for newly available COVID-19 vaccines. Existing vaccination programmes often have lower uptake among more socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Uptake of vaccines has often varied across ethnic groups, but patterns have often varied across different vaccine programmes.

Added value of this studyOur study describes the sub-groups of the UK population who are more likely to be hesitant about a COVID-19 vaccine and examines possible explanations for this. We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 survey element of the UKs largest household panel study. We asked specifically about vaccine hesitancy in relation to a COVID-19 vaccine at a time when initial results of vaccine trials were being reported in the media. We found willingness to be vaccinated is generally high across the UK population but marked differences exist across population subgroups. Willingness to be vaccinated was greater in older age groups and in men. However, some minority ethnic groups, particularly Black/Black British and Pakistani/Bangladeshi, had high levels of vaccine hesitancy but this was not seen across all minority ethnic groups. People with lower education levels were also more likely to be vaccine hesitant.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe current evidence base on vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 is rapidly emerging but remains limited. Polling data has also found relatively high levels of willingness to take up a COVID-19 vaccine and suggested greater risks of vaccine hesitancy among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people. Our study suggests that the risk of vaccine hesitancy differs across minority ethnic groups considerably, with Black ethnic groups particularly likely to be vaccine hesitant within the UK. Some White minority ethnic groups are also more likely to be vaccine hesitant than White British/Irish people.

Herd immunity may be achievable through vaccination in the UK but a focus on specific ethnic minority and socioeconomic groups is needed to ensure an equitable vaccination programme.",02/01/2021,10.1101/2020.12.27.20248899,Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi,University of Glasgow,medrxiv,0,0
142,20136,"The social experience of participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial: Subjects' motivations, others' concerns, and insights for vaccine promotion","BackgroundVaccine hesitancy could undermine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Knowledge about peoples lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake.

AimTo use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process.

MethodsWe interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of peoples lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making.

ResultsParticipants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing ones duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe.

ConclusionThese findings regarding participants reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.",05/01/2021,10.1101/2020.12.30.20249051,Emily Wentzell,University of Iowa,medrxiv,0,0
143,20367,Enisamium is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and shows improvement of recovery in COVID-19 patients in an interim analysis of a clinical trial,"Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causes a mild to severe respiratory disease called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Control of SARS-CoV-2 spread will depend on vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity. Until then, antiviral strategies are needed to manage COVID-19, but approved antiviral treatments, such as remdesivir, can only be delivered intravenously. Enisamium (laboratory code FAV00A, trade name Amizon(R)) is an orally active inhibitor of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture and clinically approved in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Here we show that enisamium can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections in NHBE and Caco-2 cells. In vitro, the previously identified enisamium metabolite VR17-04 directly inhibits the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that VR17-04 prevents GTP and UTP incorporation. To confirm enisamiums antiviral properties, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which needed medical care either with or without supplementary oxygen. Patients received either enisamium (500 mg per dose) or placebo for 7 days. A pre-planned interim analysis showed in the subgroup of patients needing supplementary oxygen (n = 77) in the enisamium group a mean recovery time of 11.1 days, compared to 13.9 days for the placebo group (log-rank test; p=0.0259). No significant difference was found for all patients (n = 373) or those only needing medical care (n = 296). These results thus suggest that enisamium is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and that enisamium treatment shortens the time to recovery for COVID-19 patients needing oxygen.

Significance statementSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Although vaccines are now becoming available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, the development of antivirals remains necessary for treating current COVID-19 patients and combating future coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we report that enisamium, which can be administered orally, can prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication and that its metabolite VR17-04 can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in vitro. Moreover, we find that COVID-19 patients requiring supplementary oxygen, recover more quickly than patients treated with a placebo. Enisamium may therefore be an accessible treatment for COVID-19 patients.",21/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.05.21249237,Aartjan Te Velthuis,University of Cambridge,medrxiv,0,0
144,20291,Epidemiological differences in the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States and China,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to forecast the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States (US) and China, two countries at different epidemic phases.

MethodsA mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression was used to investigate vaccine impact. Impact was assessed both for a vaccine that prevents infection (VES = 95%) and a vaccine that prevents only disease (VEP = 95%).

ResultsFor VES = 95% and gradual easing of restrictions, vaccination in the US reduced the peak incidence of infection, disease, and death by >55% and cumulative incidence by >32%, and in China by >77% and >65%, respectively. Nearly three vaccinations were needed to avert one infection in the US, but only one was needed in China. For VEP = 95%, benefits of vaccination were half those for VES = 95%. In both countries, the impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up, vaccine coverage >50%, and slower or no easing of restrictions, particularly in the US.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccination can flatten, delay, and/or prevent future epidemic waves. However, vaccine impact is destined to be heterogeneous across countries because of an underlying ""epidemiologic inequity"" that reduces benefits for countries already at high incidence, such as the US. Despite 95% efficacy, actual vaccine impact could be meager in such countries, if vaccine scale-up is slow, acceptance of the vaccine is poor, or restrictions are eased prematurely.

One Sentence SummaryVaccine impact will be heterogeneous across countries disadvantaging countries at high incidence. This heterogeneity can be alleviated with rapid vaccination scale-up and limited easing of restrictions.",08/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.07.21249380,Laith J Abu-Raddad,"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar",medrxiv,0,0
145,20269,A two-phase stochastic dynamic model for COVID-19 mid-term policy recommendations in Greece: a pathway towards mass vaccination,"From November 7th, 2020, Greece adopted a second nationwide lockdown policy to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the first took place from March 23rd till May 4th, 2020), just as the second wave of COVID-19 was advancing, as did other European countries. In the light of the very promising voluntary mass vaccination, which will start in January 2021, it is of utmost importance for the country to plan to complement vaccination with mid-term Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). The objective is to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until February 15th, 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from February 15th, 2021 to June 30th, 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed in the first phase: (a) a baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs on January 2021, (b) a ""semi-lockdown"" scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing and social distancing/teleworking on January 2021 and (c) a ""rolling lockdown"" scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third imposed nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some preliminary first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the ""semi-lockdown"" scenario outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities), whereas in the second phase it is of great importance to ensure a sufficient vaccine supply and high vaccination rates.",08/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.07.21249394,Nikolaos P.

146,20331,Factors indicating intention to vaccinate with a COVID-19 vaccine among older U.S. Adults,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSThe success of vaccination efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic will require broad public uptake of immunization and highlights the importance of understanding factors associated with willingness to receive a vaccine.

METHODSAdults enrolled in the Heartline clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the Heartline mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm.

RESULTSAmong 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n=7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report.

CONCLUSIONSEven among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.

147,20408,National interest may require distributing COVID-19 vaccines to other countries,"As the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine progress, understanding how to distribute the initially scarce doses is of paramount importance and a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs involved in domestic-only versus cooperative distribution is still missing. In this study we use a network Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to show under which circumstances it is in a countrys self-interest to ensure other countries can also obtain a COVID-19 vaccine rather than focusing only on vaccination of their own residents. In particular, we focus our analysis on the USs decision and estimate the internal burden of COVID-19 disease under different scenarios about vaccine cooperation. We show that in scenarios in which the US has reached the threshold for domestic herd immunity, the US may find it optimal to donate doses to other countries with lower vaccination coverage, as this would allow for a sharp reduction in the inflow of infected individuals from abroad.",14/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.11.21249610,Tiziano Rotesi,University of Lausanne,medrxiv,0,0
148,20488,Impact of COVID-19 on Migrants' Access to Primary Care:A National Qualitative Study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable changes in the delivery of primary care in the UK, including rapid digitalisation, yet the extent to which these have impacted on marginalised migrant groups - already facing existing barriers to NHS care - is unknown. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of health professionals and migrants will support initiatives to deliver more effective health services, including delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, to marginalised groups.

AimTo understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants and their access to primary healthcare, and implications for COVID-19 vaccine roll out.

Design and SettingPrimary care professionals, administrative staff, and migrants (foreign born; >18 years; <10 years in UK), were recruited in three phases using purposive, convenience and snowball sampling from urban, suburban and rural settings.

MethodsIn-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis.

Results64 clinicians were recruited in Phase 1 (25 GPs, 15 nurses, 7 HCAs, 1 Pharmacists); Phase 2 comprised administrative staff (11 PMs and 5 receptionists); and in Phase 3 we recruited 17 migrants (88% asylum seekers; 65% female; mean time in UK 4 years). We found that digitalisation and virtual consultations (telephone, video, and online form-based) have amplified existing inequalities in access to healthcare for many migrants due to lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. Use of virtual consultations has resulted in concerns around building trust and the risk of missing safeguarding cues. Participants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing healthcare due to the physical closure of surgeries. Participants reported indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. In addition, migrants reported a range of specific beliefs around COVID-19 and on potential COVID-19 vaccines, from acceptance to mistrust, often influenced by misinformation. PCPs raised concerns that migrants may have increased risk factors for poor general health and to severe illness from COVID-19, in part due to their social and economic situation. Innovative opportunities were suggested to engage migrant groups through translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube which merit further exploration.

ConclusionPandemic-related changes in primary care delivery may be here to stay, and some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. As primary care networks operationalise the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, these findings provide critical information on specific strategies required to support migrant population to access primary care and overcome misinformation around COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine.

How this fits inThe impact of pandemic-related shifts in primary care delivery on marginalised migrant groups, who may already face major disparities in accessing primary care, is poorly elucidated. We found that the rapid digitalisation of primary care services and physical closure of surgeries during the pandemic have amplified disparities in access to healthcare for specific migrant groups, with many lacking access to and capacity to use technology, compounded by language barriers. Migrants may be at increased risk of misinformation about COVID-19, which merits further consideration as COVID-19 vaccine roll out begins. Improved outreach to local migrant community organisations and places of worship, alongside co-designing with migrants more inclusive delivery approaches and creative integration of migrant ambassadors into information-sharing campaigns are needed. Primary care can maximise the opportunities of digitalisation for migrants through flexible engagement by multiple modalities (e.g. text, email, letter and YouTube videos) to provide targeted, translated advice and information, virtual group consultations for patients with a specific condition, and working with local leaders and NGOs to access and disseminate information through informal communication channels.",15/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.12.21249692,Sally Hargreaves,"The Migrant Health Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George\'s, University of London",medrxiv,0,0
149,20555,Optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation using real-time seroprevalence estimates in Rhode Island and Massachusetts,"As three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines come to market in Europe and North America in the winter of 2020-2021, distribution networks will be in a race against a major epidemiological wave of SARS-CoV-2 that began in autumn 2020. Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation is critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health-care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with co-morbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression. Here, we evaluate various age-based vaccine distributions using a validated mathematical model based on current epidemic trends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not be included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for current age-specific immune patterns in both states. We find that allocating a substantial proportion (> 75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. As we do not explicitly model other high mortality groups, this result on vaccine allocation applies to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. Our analysis confirms that for an easily transmissible respiratory virus, allocating a large majority of vaccinations to groups with the highest mortality risk is optimal. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020-2021 have equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff. Vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and will result in 1% to 2% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021. Assuming high vaccination coverage (> 28%) and no major relaxations in distancing, masking, gathering size, or hygiene guidelines between now and spring 2021, our model predicts that a combination of vaccination and population immunity will lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.",15/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.12.21249694,Maciej F Boni,"Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA",medrxiv,0,0
150,20604,Insights from a Pan India Sero-Epidemiological survey (Phenome-India Cohort) for SARS-CoV2,"Background: India has been amongst the most affected nations during the SARS CoV2 pandemic, with sparse data on country wide spread of asymptomatic infections and antibody persistence. This longitudinal cohort study was aimed to evaluate SARS CoV2 seropositivity rate as a marker of infection and evaluate temporal persistence of antibodies with neutralization capability and to infer possible risk factors for infection. Methods: Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR) with its more than 40 laboratories and centers in urban and semi urban settings spread across the country piloted the pan country surveillance. 10427 adult individuals working in CSIR laboratories and their family members based on voluntary participation were assessed for antibody presence and stability was analyzed over 6 months utilizing qualitative Elecysys SARS CoV2 specific antibody kit and GENScript cPass SARS CoV2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. Along with demographic information, possible risk factors were evaluated through self to be filled online forms with data acquired on blood group type, occupation type, addiction and habits including smoking and alcohol, diet preferences, medical history and transport type utilized. Symptom history and information on possible contact and compliance with COVID 19 universal precautions was also obtained. Findings:1058 individuals (10.14%) had antibodies against SARS CoV2. A follow up on 346 seropositive individuals after three months revealed stable to higher antibody levels against SARS CoV2 but declining plasma activity for neutralizing SARS CoV2 receptor binding domain and ACE2 interaction. A repeat sampling of 35 individuals, at six months, revealed declining antibody levels while the neutralizing activity remained stable compared to three months. Majority of seropositive individuals (75%) did not recall even one of nine symptoms since March 2020. Fever was the most common symptom with one fourth reporting loss of taste or smell. Significantly associated risks for seropositivity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value) were observed with usage of public transport (1.79, 1.43 to 2*24, 2.81561x10-6), occupational responsibilities such as security, housekeeping personnel etc. (2.23, 1.92 to 2.59, 6.43969x10-26), non smokers (1.52, 1.16 to 1.99, 0.02) and non vegetarianism (1.67, 1.41 to 1.99, 3.03821x10-8). An iterative regression analysis was confirmatory and led to only modest changes to estimates. Predilections for seropositivity was noted with specific ABO blood groups; O was associated with a lower risk. Interpretation: In a first of its kind study from India, we report the seropositivity in a country wide cohort and identify variable susceptible associations for contacting infection. Serology and Neutralizing Antibody response provides much sought for general insights on the immune response to the virus among Indians and will be an important resource for designing vaccination strategies.

To evaluate the duration of protection while allowing trial participants timely access to efficacious vaccine, investigators can sequentially cross placebo recipients to the vaccine arm according to priority groups. Here, we show how to estimate potentially time-varying placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy in this type of staggered vaccination of placebo recipients. In addition, we compare the performance of blinded and unblinded crossover designs in estimating long-term vaccine efficacy.

SummaryWe show how to estimate potentially waning long-term efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with staggered enrollment of participants and sequential crossover of placebo recipients.",21/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.13.21249779,Danyu Lin,University of North Carolina,medrxiv,0,0
152,20540,Evaluating the effects of re-opening plans on dynamics of COVID-19 in SP,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in early March 2020. In Brazil, Sao Paulo is the most affected state, comprising about 20% of the countrys cases. With no vaccine available to date, distancing measures have been taken to reduce virus transmission. To reduce the pandemics effect on the economy, the government of Sao Paulo has proposed a plan consisting of five phases of the gradual re-opening of activities. In this context, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate the gradual re-opening plan on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, in the city of Sao Paulo. The model shows that a precipitous reopening can cause a higher peak of the disease, which may compromise the local health system. Waiting for the reduction in the incidence of infected individuals for at least 15 days to phase transition is the most efficient strategy compared to the fixed-period scenario at each phase of the re-opening plan.",15/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.14.21249809,Felipe Alves Rubio,University of Campinas,medrxiv,0,0
153,20727,"Immunisation, asymptomatic infection, herd immunity and the new variants of COVID-19","ObjectivesIs ""herd immunity"" to COVID-19 a realistic outcome of any immunisation programme with the two main vaccines currently licenced in the UK (Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 and Astra Zeneca/Oxford vaccine ChAdOx1-S)? More formally, can these vaccines achieve a sufficient level of population immunity to reduce R, the reproduction number of the infection, to below one in the absence of any non-pharmaceutical interventions?

DesignThe study uses simple mathematical models of the transmission of COVID-19 infection from primary to secondary cases parameterised using data on virus transmission and vaccine efficacy from the literature and the regulatory approval process for the vaccines.

ResultsIn the regulatory approval documents, the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine is estimated at 0.948 (that for the Moderna vaccine is similar). Efficacy for the Oxford vaccine against primary symptomatic illness is estimated as 0.704, based on pooling of data from two dose regimes. For values of R0 similar to those reported during the first months of the pandemic, the simplest analysis implies that reducing the value of R below 1 would require 69% and 93% of the population to be vaccinated with the Pfizer and Oxford vaccine respectively (or achieve a comparable level of immunity through natural infection). However, the new variant of COVID-19 (Lineage B.1.1.7, named Variant of Concern VOC-202012/01) is reported to have an R-value 1.56 (0.92 to 2.28) times higher than the original strain. Vaccinating the entire population with the Oxford vaccine would only reduce the R value to 1.325 while the Pfizer vaccine would require 82% of the population to be vaccinated to control the spread of the new variant.

The Oxford vaccine reduces the incidence of serious illness to a greater extent than it reduces symptomatic illness. But its efficacy against the incidence of asymptomatic infections is lower, reducing its efficacy against all infection from 0.704 to 0.525 for the pooled data. Although asymptomatics are less infectious, including them in our calculations still raises R values by 20% or more, from 1.33 to 1.6 for the new variant with 100% vaccination. Neither vaccine is licenced for use in children, and when this is taken into account, this R value rises by a further 37% to 2.2 if the whole adult population is vaccinated. Even the more effective mRNA vaccines may allow the pandemic to persist via transmission amongst children, as current authorisations only allow their use on adults. In the absence of vaccination, R will reduce to 1 when 89% of the population has acquired immunity as a result of previous infection with COVID-19.

ConclusionsAll currently licensed vaccines provide substantial protection against serious illness to vaccinated individuals themselves. But the Oxford vaccine appears to have relatively low efficacy against asymptomatic infections. Although no comparable data from human trials are available for the mRNA vaccines, non-human primate studies suggest they are better at preventing nasal shedding and so transmission. Herd immunity to COVID-19 will be very difficult to achieve, especially so for the less effective vaccine. The possibility of transmission from vaccinated but infected individuals to vulnerable unvaccinated individuals is of serious concern. There is a strong case for preferring the more effective mRNA vaccines for health and social care workers and those who have contact with large numbers of vulnerable others.",20/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.16.21249946,Alastair Grant,University of East Anglia,medrxiv,0,0
154,20640,Sleeping under the waves: a longitudinal study across the contagion peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,"After the March-April 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe in autumn. This study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation.

A total of 2013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being at high-risk for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior two weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior two weeks, being pessimistic on the vaccine, and working in healthcare were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we showed reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction and sleep medication use, and advanced sleep phase, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers ([~]60%) and severe depression ([~]20%) in a context of increased perceived stress.

This study demonstrated a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health.

155,20718,The burden of nosocomial covid-19: results from the Wales multi-centre retrospective observational study of 2518 hospitalised adults.,"ObjectivesTo define the burden of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) novel pandemic coronavirus (covid-19) infection among adults hospitalised across Wales.

DesignRetrospective observational study of adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st March - 1st July 2020 with a recorded hospital admission within the subsequent 31 days. Outcomes were collected up to 20th November using a standardised online data collection tool.

SettingService evaluation performed across 18 secondary or tertiary care hospitals.

Participants4112 admissions with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result between 1st March to 1st July 2020 were screened. Anonymised data from 2518 participants were returned, representing over 60% of adults hospitalised across the nation of Wales.

Main outcome measuresThe prevalence and outcomes (death, discharge) for nosocomial covid-19, assessed across of a range of possible case definitions.

ResultsInpatient mortality rates for nosocomial covid-19 ranged from 38% to 42% and remained consistently higher than participants with community-acquired infection (31% to 35%) across a range of case definitions. Participants with nosocomial-acquired infection were an older, frailer, and multi-morbid population than those with community-acquired infection. Based on the Public Health Wales case definition, 50% of participants had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnostic testing.

ConclusionsThis represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients with nosocomial covid-19 in the UK to date. These findings suggest that inpatient mortality rates from nosocomial-infection are likely higher than previously reported, emphasizing the importance of infection control measures, and supports prioritisation of vaccination for covid-19 negative admissions and trials of post-exposure prophylaxis in inpatient cohorts.

Trial registrationThis project was approved and sponsored by the Welsh Government, as part of a national audit and quality improvement scheme for patients hospitalised covid-19 across Wales.

Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science up until 31-December-2020 for studies reporting on patient outcomes following hospital-acquired infection due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We identified a range of case-definitions for hospital-acquired infection, based on timing of diagnostic testing 5 to 15 days following admission. The largest and only multi-centre study concluded individuals with nosocomial infection are at a lower risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 than those infected in the community, however, was performed early in the pandemic and utilised a conservative definition of nosocomial infection.

What this study addsOur multi-centre observational study represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients with nosocomial covid-19 in the UK to date, and suggests the burden of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection has been underestimated. Nosocomial-infection occurred in older, frailer, and multi-morbid individuals, and was consistently associated with greater inpatient mortality than amongst those who were infected in the community across a spectrum of case-definitions. Our findings support implementation of enhanced infection control measures to reduce this burden during future waves, especially given the recent emergence of novel viral variants with enhanced transmissibility. Furthermore, roughly half of the patients meeting the Public Health Wales definition of definite nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnosis, highlighting a potential window of opportunity for inpatient pre-exposure and/or post-exposure prophylaxis.",20/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.18.21249433,Simon M Barry,"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board",medrxiv,0,0
157,20765,Impact of immediate and preferential relaxation of social and travel restrictions for vaccinated people on the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 : a model-based analysis,"BackgroundFour COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer, Moderna, University of Oxford/ Astra Zeneca (also Oxford/ Serum Institute of India) and ICMR/ Bharat Biotech have been granted emergency use authorization in the democratic world following established clinical trial procedures in their respective countries. Vaccination of the general public is expected to begin in several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately cleared to return to normal activities, including hassle-free travel.

MethodsWe use a delay differential equation model developed previously by our group to calculate the effects of vaccinee ""immunity passports"" on the spreading trajectories of the disease. We consider default virus strains as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 in our analysis.

ResultsWe find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, vaccinees may be immediately cleared for normal life with no significant increase in case counts. Free travel of such vaccinees between two regions should not jeopardize the infection control performance of either. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be eight months or more before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or eliminated. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent however, social as well as travel restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until transmission of the disease is eliminated.

ConclusionsDesigning high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drive with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants if any of efficacy, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death toll and socioeconomic cost.",20/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.19.21250100,B Shayak,Cornell University,medrxiv,0,0
158,20754,Modeling the population effects of epitope specific escape mutations in SARS-CoV-2 to guide vaccination strategies,"Escape mutations (EM) to SARS-Cov-2 have been detected and are spreading. Vaccines may need adjustment to respond to these or future mutations. We designed a population level model integrating both waning immunity and EM. We also designed a set of criteria for elaborating and fitting this model to cross-neutralization and other data in a manner that minimizes vaccine decision errors. We formulated four model variations. These define criteria for which prior infections provide immunity that can be escaped. They also specify different sequences where one EM follows another. At all reasonable parameter values, these model variations led to patterns where: 1) EM were rare in the first epidemic, 2) rebound epidemics after the first epidemic were accelerated more by increasing drifting than by increasing waning (with some exceptions), 3) the long term endemic level of infection was determined mostly by waning rates with small effects of the drifting parameter, 4) EM caused loss of vaccine effectiveness and under some conditions, vaccines induced EM that caused higher levels of infection with vaccines than without them. The differences and similarities across the four models suggest paths for developing models specifying the epitopes where EM act. This model is a base on which to construct epitope specific evolutionary models using new high-throughput assay data from population samples to guide vaccine decisions.

HighlightsO_LIThis model is the first to integrate both antigenic drifting from escape mutations and immunity waning in continuous time.
C_LIO_LITiny amounts of only waning or only escape mutation drifting have small or no effects. Together, they have large effects.
C_LIO_LIThere are no or few escape mutations during the first epidemic peak and no effect of drifting parameters on the size of that wave.
C_LIO_LIAfter the first epidemic peak, escape mutations accumulate rapidly. They increase with increases in waning rates and with increases in the drifting rate. Escape mutations then amplify other escape mutations since these raise the frequency of reinfections.
C_LIO_LIEscape mutations can completely negate the effects of vaccines and even lead to more infections with vaccination than without, especially at very low waning rates.
C_LIO_LIThe model generates population level cross-neutralization patterns that enable the model to be fitted to population level serological data.
C_LIO_LIThe model can be modified to use laboratory data that determine the epitope specific effects of mutations on ACE2 attachment strength or escape from antibody effects.
C_LIO_LIThe model, although currently unable to predict the effects of escape mutations in the real world, opens up a path that can guide model incorporation of molecularly studied escape mutations and improve predictive value. We describe that path.
C_LIO_LIModel analysis indicates that vaccine trials and serological surveys are needed now to detect the effects of epitope specific escape mutations that could cause the loss of vaccine efficacy.

159,20791,Simulating the impact of different vaccination policies on the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City,"PurposeTo analyze potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation scenarios and vaccine rollout policies from early Jan 2021 to end of June 2021.

Key findingsIn anticipation of the potential arrival and dominance of the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant:

O_LIMass-vaccination would be critical to mitigating epidemic severity (26-52% reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to no vaccination, provided the new UK variant supplants currently circulating variants).
C_LIO_LIPrioritizing key risk groups for earlier vaccination would lead to greater reductions in hospitalizations and deaths than infections. Thus, in general this would be a good strategy.
C_LIO_LICurrent vaccination prioritization policy is suboptimal. To avert more hospitalizations and deaths, mass-vaccination of all individuals 65 years or older should be done as soon as possible. For groups listed in the same phase, 65+ year-olds should be given first priority ahead of others.
C_LIO_LIAvailable vaccine doses should be given to the next priority groups as soon as possible without awaiting hesitant up-stream groups.
C_LIO_LIWhile efficacy of vaccination off-protocol is unknown, provided immune response following a first vaccine dose persists, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose by [~]1 month (i.e. administer the two doses 8 weeks apart) can substantially reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to the 3-week apart regimen. Across all scenarios tested here, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose leads to the largest reduction in severe epidemic outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and deaths). Therefore, to protect as many people as possible, this strategy should be considered if rapid increases in infections, hospitalization or deaths and/or shortages in vaccines were to occur.

160,20842,An interactive COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker (CovMT) with a particular focus on critical mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of the Spike protein,"Almost one year has passed since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of confirmed SARS-Cov-2 cases worldwide has now reached [~]92 million, with 2 million reported deaths (https://covid19.who.int). Nearly 400,000 SARS-Cov-2 genomes were sequenced from COVID-19 samples and added to public resources such as GISAID (https://gisaid.org). With the vaccines becoming available or entering trials (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org), it is vital to keep track of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the Spike proteins Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region, which could have a potential impact on disease severity and treatment strategies.1-3 In the wake of a recent increase in cases with a potentially more infective RBD mutation (N501Y) in the United Kingdom, countries worldwide are concerned about the spread of this or similar variants. Impressive sampling and timely increase in sequencing efforts related to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) helped detect and monitor the spread of the new N501Y variant. Similar sequencing efforts are needed in other countries for timely tracking of this or different variants. To track geographic sequencing efforts and mutations, with a particular focus on RBD region of the Spike protein, we present our daily updated COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker system, see https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/covmt.",25/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.22.21249716,Intikhab Alam,"Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.",medrxiv,0,0
161,20861,An external validation of the QCovid risk prediction algorithm for risk of mortality from COVID-19 in adults: national validation cohort study in England,"BackgroundTo externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study using the ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort based on the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service Data for pandemic planning and research, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two time periods were used: (a) 24th January to 30th April 2020; and (b) 1st May to 28th July 2020. We evaluated the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration for each validation time period.

FindingsThe study comprises 34,897,648 adults aged 19-100 years resident in England. There were 26,985 COVID-19 deaths during the first time-period and 13,177 during the second. The algorithms had good calibration in the validation cohort in both time periods with close correspondence of observed and predicted risks. They explained 77.1% (95% CI: 76.9% to 77.4%) of the variation in time to death in men in the first time-period (R2); the D statistic was 3.76 (95% CI: 3.73 to 3.79); Harrells C was 0.935 (0.933 to 0.937). Similar results were obtained for women, and in the second time-period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first time period was 65.9% for men and 71.7% for women. People in the top 20% of predicted risks of death accounted for 90.8% of all COVID-19 deaths for men and 93.0% for women.

InterpretationThe QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. It has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPublic policy measures and clinical risk assessment relevant to COVID-19 need to be aided by rigorously developed and validated risk prediction models. A recent living systematic review of published risk prediction models for COVID-19 found most models are subject to a high risk of bias with optimistic reported performance, raising concern that these models may be unreliable when applied in practice. A population-based risk prediction model, QCovid risk prediction algorithm, has recently been developed to identify adults at high risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, which overcome many of the limitations of previous tools.

Added value of this studyCommissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for England, we validated the novel clinical risk prediction model (QCovid) to identify risks of short-term severe outcomes due to COVID-19. We used national linked datasets from general practice, death registry and hospital episode data for a population-representative sample of over 34 million adults. The risk models have excellent discrimination in men and women (Harrells C statistic>0.9) and are well calibrated. QCovid represents a new, evidence-based opportunity for population risk-stratification.

Implications of all the available evidenceQCovid has the potential to support public health policy, from enabling shared decision making between clinicians and patients in relation to health and work risks, to targeted recruitment for clinical trials, and prioritisation of vaccination, for example.",25/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.22.21249968,Vahe Nafilyan,Office for National Statistics,medrxiv,0,0
162,21037,Community structured model for vaccine strategies to control COVID19 spread: a mathematical study,"Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",26/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.25.21250505,Huaiping Zhu,York University,medrxiv,0,0
163,21069,"The angiotensin type 2 receptor agonist C21 restores respiratory function in COVID19 - a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial","BackgroundAlthough several therapies have been evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 are still significant, and the need for safe and effective drugs remains high even after launch of vaccine programs.

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with the novel oral angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist C21 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with C-reactive protein 50-150 mg/L but not needing mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to oral C21 (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days in addition to standard of care, including glucocorticoids and remdesivir.

Results106 patients underwent randomization (51 in the C21 group and 55 in the placebo group). At day 14 after start of treatment, the proportion of patients still requiring supplemental oxygen was significantly reduced by 90% in the C21 group compared to the placebo group (p=0.003). Moreover, fewer patients required mechanical ventilation (one C21 patient and four placebo patients), and C21 was associated with a numerical reduction in the mortality rate (one and three deaths in the C21 and placebo group, respectively). Treatment with C21 was safe and well tolerated.

ConclusionsAs studied in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, C21 on top of standard of care led to a clinically beneficial improvement in respiratory function compared to placebo, paving the way for a pivotal randomised controlled trial.

166,21133,Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose,"COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States require two doses, administered three to four weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with the rise of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, have sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy against disease following the first dose, vaccine efficacy against infection, and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines with 80% efficacy following the first dose, a delay of 9-12 weeks could enhance the program effectiveness and prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to a 4-week interval between the doses. However, for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with demonstrated efficacy of 52% after the first dose, there was no clear advantage for delaying the second dose beyond the 3-week tested schedule, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose as well as vaccine efficacy against infection in order to determine the optimal time interval between the two doses.",29/01/2021,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250619,Seyed M.

We developed a mathematical model capable of capturing the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 dissemination aligned with social distancing, isolation measures, and vaccination. The city of Rio de Janeiro provides a case study to analyze possible scenarios including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination in the epidemic scenario. Our results shows that a combination of different policies such as case isolation and social distancing are more effective for mitigating the epidemics. Furthermore, these policies will still be necessary in a phased vaccination program.

168,21365,Vaccinating Australia: How long will it take?,"The Australian Governments COVID-19 vaccine rollout strategy is scheduled to commence in late February 2021 and aims to vaccinate the Australian adult population by the end of October 2021. The task of vaccinating some 20 million people within this timeframe presents considerable logistical challenges. Key to meeting this target is the rate of vaccine delivery: the number of vaccine doses that can be administered per day. In the opening phase, high priority groups will receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through hospital hubs at an initial rate of 80,000 doses per week. However, pending regulatory approval, the currently announced plan appears to be to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine to the bulk of the popluation through a combination of general practices and community pharmacies. Here, we run a series of projections to estimate how long it will take to vaccinate the Australian population under different assumptions about the rate of vaccine administration as well as the schedule for second doses and prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis highlights the ambitious rate of vaccine administration that will be neccessary to meet the Australian Government completion target of October 2021. A rate of 200,000 doses per day would comfortably meet that target; 80,000 doses a day would see roll-out extended until mid-2022. Speed is of the essence when it comes to vaccine rollout: protecting the population quickly will minimise the risk of sporadic and costly lockdowns lockdowns and the potential for small, local clusters getting out of control and sparking new epidemic waves. The government should gather all its resources to maximise the daily vaccination rate, ideally aiming to ramp up administration to at least 200,000 doses per day as quickly as possible. Quickly achieving and maintaining this pace will likely require dedicated large-scale vaccination sites that are capable of delivering thousands of doses a week in addition to the enthusiastic participation of GP practices and community pharmacies around the country. Lessons on the neccessary logistical planning, including coordination of delivery, ultra-cold-chain storage and staffing, can potentially be learned from Israel, where between 7,000 and 20,000 vaccinations per million population have been delivered daily throughout January.",04/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.02.21250979,Mark J Hanly,UNSW Australia,medrxiv,0,0
170,21548,DrugWAS: Leveraging drug-wide association studies to facilitate drug repurposing for COVID-19,"ImportanceThere is an unprecedented need to rapidly identify safe and effective treatments for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ObjectiveTo systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as potential treatment for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBased on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data, drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on COVID-19 disease outcomes.

ExposuresPatient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in structured format.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause of death was selected as primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes.

ResultsThe study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized, 82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%) died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids), methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and fluticasone.

171,21643,Poor antigen-specific responses to the second BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals,"The advent of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. Vaccine candidates have demonstrated robust humoral responses and have protected against infection. However, efficacy trials were focused on individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and, as a result, little is known about immune responses induced by these mRNA vaccines in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immune responses in 32 subjects who received two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. In individuals naive to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. These data highlight an important gap in our knowledge and may have major implications for how these vaccines should be used to prevent COVID-19.

172,21616,Global impact and cost-effectiveness of one-dose versus two-dose human papillomavirus vaccination schedules: a comparative modelling analysis,"BackgroundTo eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, WHO currently recommends routine vaccination of adolescent girls with two doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine before sexual debut. However, many countries have yet to implement this because of financial or logistical barriers to delivering two doses outside the infant immunisation programme.

MethodsUsing three independent HPV transmission models, we estimated the long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness of one-dose versus two-dose HPV vaccination, in 192 countries, assuming that one dose of the vaccine gives either a shorter duration of full protection (20 or 30 years) or lifelong protection but lower vaccine efficacy (e.g., 80%) compared to two doses. We simulated routine vaccination with the 9-valent HPV vaccine in 10-year-old girls at 80% coverage for the years 2021-2120, with a one-year catch-up of 80% 11-14-year-old girls on the first year of the programme.

FindingsOver the next century, one-dose vaccination at 80% coverage could avert 64 million (80%UI 62{middle dot}2-64{middle dot}8) and 66{middle dot}6 million (80%UI 63{middle dot}4-69{middle dot}1) cervical cancer cases should one dose of the vaccine confer 20 and 30 years of protection, respectively. Should one dose of the vaccine provide lifelong protection at 80% vaccine efficacy, 68{middle dot}4 million (80%UI 63{middle dot}8-69{middle dot}4) cervical cancer cases could be prevented. Across all country income groups, two-dose schedules conferring lifelong protection would avert only slightly more cases (2{middle dot}1-8{middle dot}7 million) than the one-dose scenarios explored. Around 330 to 5230 additional girls need to be vaccinated with the second dose to prevent one cervical cancer case, depending on the epidemiological profiles of the country.

InterpretationResults were consistent across the three independent models and suggest that one-dose vaccination has similar health benefits to a two-dose programme while simplifying vaccine delivery, reducing costs and alleviating vaccine supply constraints.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrimary prevention of cervical cancer is now available with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Initially administered as a three-dose regimen, the HPV vaccine schedule recommended by WHO has now switched to two doses for individuals below the age of 15 years. Although WHO recommends all countries to routinely immunise adolescent girls with two doses, many low- and middle-income countries, with high disease burden, have yet to implement national HPV vaccination programmes because of the challenges of delivering two vaccine doses to adolescent females. Recently, HPV vaccine implementation in many countries has been further delayed due to constraints in vaccine supply and difficulties in access during COVID-19 epidemics. These financial, logistical, and supply constraints have motivated research into one-dose vaccination schedules. Evidence emerging from trials and observational studies suggests that one dose may also provide a high level of protection against incident and persistent HPV infections. If proven effective, the one-dose HPV vaccination schedule would simplify vaccine delivery and lower costs of national vaccination programmes, potentially enabling more countries to implement one and as a result, facilitating global cervical cancer prevention. We searched PubMed for trials, cohort and modelling studies published in 2018 and 2020, with the terms ""(health impact OR impact OR modelling OR cost-effectiveness OR CEA OR durability OR effectiveness) AND (HPV OR human papillomavirus OR cervical cancer)"" and identified 151 results. Ten published articles--four trials, three cohort studies, two modelling analyses, one systematic review of trials--evaluated the population impact of one dose of the vaccine on cervical cancer disease outcome among females and all studies showed one dose of the vaccine might be as effective as two doses in preventing HPV infection. However as the trials and cohorts were single-country studies in select populations, the global impact remains unknown. Both published modelling analyses only used one model to estimate the impact of one-dose vaccination, and only examined a few countries. To our knowledge, no published article has modelled the global impact of routine one-dose vaccination on cervical cancer prevention by synthesising the results from more than one model.

Added value of this studyThis study presents the first evidence on the potential global impact of a routine one-dose regimen, from a comparative modelling analysis that synthesises results from three published dynamic models calibrated to countries with varying epidemiological and demographic profiles. We found consistent results across all models suggesting that routine one-dose vaccination provides the majority of health benefits to the two-dose programme should a single dose of the vaccine confer more than 20 years of protection at full potential efficacy or 80% efficacy with lifelong protection.

Implications of all the available evidenceFindings suggest that routine one-dose vaccinations could avert almost as many cervical cancer cases as a two-dose programme. The one-dose regimen would be cheaper and easier to implement for most countries while alleviating vaccine supply constraints. To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have had to implement stringent physical distancing measures, which has led to the suspension of routine immunisation programmes. Public health authorities grapple with the logistic challenges of delivering immunisation services while minimising the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Compared to the two-dose vaccination schedule, a one-dose vaccination schedule would reduce interactions between vaccinees and health workers, simplifying vaccine delivery while also decreasing SARS-CoV-2 exposure.",08/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.08.21251186,Kiesha Prem,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,medrxiv,0,0

This report aims to analyze the association of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and two macro-socioeconomics measures, including human development index (HDI) and Gross domestic product (GDP), among 25 countries till the first week of February 2021. Our results indicate that a higher GDP per Capita is positively associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine distribution. However, UAE and Israel have more successful vaccine distribution outcomes regardless of their GDP. In addition, the result shows HDI does not have a significant relationship with vaccine distribution. Although these macro-socioeconomic measures may be counted as a vital indicator for vaccine distribution, other factors may play roles in vaccine distribution, including well-developed health infrastructure, a centralized political system, and population size.",15/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.09.21251436,Ali Roghani,University of Utah,medrxiv,0,0
174,21757,'Leading from the front implementation strategies increase the success of influenza vaccination drives among healthcare workers: A reanalysis of Systematic Review evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA),"BackgroundSeasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is widely recommended to protect staff and patients. A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that  substantial heterogeneity remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity.

MethodsWe used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically analyse associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions.

ResultsIn Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of  leading from the front rather than  top-down implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions  dont-go-in-cold with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. Reapplying the  leading from the front theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns.

ConclusionsRegardless of intervention type a  leading from the front approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success. While the results pertain to flu vaccination among HCWs, the components identified here may be relevant to public health campaigns regarding COVID-19 vaccination.",15/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.10.21251475,Katy Sutcliffe,"EPPI-Centre, Social Research Institute, University College London",medrxiv,0,0
175,21937,'Trained immunity' from Mycobacterium spp. (environmental or BCG) exposure predicts protection from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Endeavors to identify protective variables that could be potentially responsible for reduced COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within the first 5 years of life while most of the COVID-19 cases as well as deaths have been observed in adults especially the aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed desired protection being investigated could come from heterologous  trained immunity conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. (i.e., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of  trained immunity of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) of populations would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four) as well as erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher trained immunity prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower trained immunity prevalence neighbors. The incidences, mortality, and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) of COVID-19 are found negatively correlated with the trained immunity of populations that have comparable underlying confounders not the BCG coverage per se. It is submitted that to decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit that can be gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of trained immunity as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b) small study groups of higher background trained immunity could fail to indicate any protective effect.",19/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.11.20233593,Samer Singh,Banaras Hindu University,medrxiv,0,0

Given the ongoing vaccine rollout to healthcare personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, here we provide a preliminary assessment of real-world vaccination efficacy in 62,138 individuals from the Mayo Clinic and associated health system (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin) between December 1st 2020 and February 8th 2021. Our retrospective analysis contrasts 31,069 individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who are propensity-matched based on demographics, location (zip code), and number of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and were at risk for infection at least 36 days after their first dose. Administration of two COVID-19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. Furthermore, vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than propensity-matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk: 0.4; p-value: 0.007). Building upon the previous randomized trials of these vaccines, this study demonstrates their real-world effectiveness in reducing the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity among individuals at highest risk for infection.",27/02/2021,10.1101/2021.02.15.21251623,Venky Soundararajan,nference,medrxiv,0,0
