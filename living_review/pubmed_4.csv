We applied a systems serology approach to identify Vi-specific serological correlates of protection using samples obtained from participants enrolled in an experimental controlled human infection study. Participants were vaccinated with Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Vi-TT) or unconjugated Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS) vaccines and w","2020","11","23","J Exp Med","The Journal of experimental medicine","Adult; Bacterial Load; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Immunoglobulin G; Time Factors; Typhoid Fever; Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines; Vaccines, Conjugate","Jin","Celina","Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK",NA

The virus has structural and non-structural proteins that are considered as possible targets. Receptor recognition is the critical determinant and preliminary phase of viral infection to enter the host cell and causes tissue tropism.
